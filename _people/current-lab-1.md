### Sarah P. Flanagan

Dr. Sarah Flanagan is a Lecturer in Evolutionary Biology in the [School of Biological Sciences at the University of Canterbury](http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/biological-sciences/) in Christchurch, New Zealand. She earned her Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Colby College in Waterville, Maine, USA in 2011. In 2016 she completed her PhD in Biology with [Adam Jones](https://pipefishguysite.wordpress.com/) at Texas A&M University, and then was a postdoctoral fellow at the [National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis](http://www.nimbios.org/) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 

My research focuses on the evolution of complex traits and how selection interacts with the genome. My research activities fall into two major categories: (1) understanding how sexual selection acts on traits and shapes mating systems and (2) investigating the genomic basis of traits, including the signature selection leaves on the genome. Read more about Sarah on her [personal website]( https://sarahpflanagan.wordpress.com/), where she maintains a blog.

### Micaela Pullen

Micaela is a master's student working on monitoring a population of pipefish that reside in seagrass beds in Duvauchelle Bay. More generally, she is interested in how organisms influence each other and the environment around them.

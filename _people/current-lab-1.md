### Sarah P. Flanagan

<img align="left" src='/images/IMG_20190717_152944_exported_932_1570595349060.jpg' height='266' width='200'> Dr. Sarah Flanagan is a Senior Lecturer in Evolutionary Biology in the [School of Biological Sciences at the University of Canterbury](http://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/biological-sciences/) in Christchurch, New Zealand. She earned her Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Colby College in Waterville, Maine, USA in 2011. In 2016 she completed her PhD in Biology with [Adam Jones](https://pipefishguysite.wordpress.com/) at Texas A&M University, and then was a postdoctoral fellow at the [National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis](http://www.nimbios.org/) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. 

Sarah's research focuses on the evolution of complex traits and how selection interacts with the genome. The lab's research activities fall into two major categories: (1) understanding how sexual selection acts on traits and shapes mating systems and (2) investigating the genomic basis of traits, including the signature selection leaves on the genome. Read more about Sarah on her [personal website]( https://sarahpflanagan.wordpress.com/), where she maintains a blog.

### Coley Tosto
<img align="left" src='/images/ColeyTosto.jpg' width="20%" height="20%"> Coley Tosto is currently working towards a Ph.D. in Biological Sciences investigating the role sexual selection pressures have in sex-biased gene expression using pipefish as a model system. Her overall research interests surround the evolution of different mating systems and all the factors that are involved in shaping them. She is working in collaboration with [Heather Masonjones](https://www.ut.edu/directory/masonjones-heather) and [Emily Rose](https://www.valdosta.edu/about/directory/profile/erose).

### Lucy Howell

<img align="right" src='/images/lucyhowell.png' width="40%" height="40%"> Lucy is an [Aho Hīnātore/Accelerator Scholarship](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/postgraduate/aho-hinatore-accelerator-scholarship/) PhD student. She is using environmental DNA to study populations of little blue penguins. She is co-supervised by Sarah and [Michelle LaRue](https://www.drmichellelarue.com/) with [Tammy Steeves](http://www.ucconsert.org/people/) as an associate supervisor.

### Emily Beasley

<img align="left" src='/images/EmilyBeasley.jpg' width="20%" height="20%"> Emily Beasley is currently working towards a PhD in Biological Sciences. She is using pipefish as a model species to investigate the role of sexual selection in the evolution of sex-biased gene expression. Emily earned her undergraduate honours degree from Saint Mary’s University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, in 2015. In 2018, she completed her MSc by Research at Middlesex University in London, England. Her current research interests include evolutionary biology, evolutionary game theory, conservation biology, and behavioural ecology.

### Alexandra Cox

<img align="left" src='/images/AlexandraCox.jpeg' width="30%" height="30%"> Alexandra is a Masters student co-supervised by Sarah and [Dr Claudia Meisrimler](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/contact-us/people/claudia-meisrimler.html), whose thesis project is supported by the [Bioprotection Aotearoa Center of Research Excellence](https://bioprotection.org.nz/). Her work focuses on the parasitic oomycete, *Phytophthora cinnamomi* and identifying the genes responsible for its pathogenicity. By annotating the genome of *P. cinnamomi*, Alexandra’s work will contribute to a larger effort in developing counter measures against this invasive species. Her main research interests are bioinformatics, molecular genetics, plant biology and conservation.

### Jude van Houtte

<img align="right" src='/images/jude-flanagan lab.jpg' width="20%" height="20%"> Jude is an undergraduate student working towards her BSc, majoring in Biological Science. She has joined the lab through a summer research opportunity with UC, where she will work in collaboration with Emily Beasley studying sexual selection and behaviour in sex-role-reversed pipefish. She is interested in conservation, ethology, and evolution, as well as mātauranga Māori and the connection between science and people.

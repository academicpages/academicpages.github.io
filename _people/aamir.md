Aamir is a first-year MRC Advanced Interdisciplinary Methods (AIM) DTP PhD student. His research interests involve using a combination of behavioral tasks, computational modeling, and neuroimaging to understand social decision-making, and using this knowledge to inform the precision-based treatment of mental health disorders. He aims to use these methods to identify the neurocomputational mechanisms and associated brain regions affecting learning in social anxiety, and in a novel initiative, attempt to alleviate these changes using a mobile app-based cognitive therapy program.

P and S wave tomography of Southeast Canada: Insights into mantle development and evolution from Archean to Phanerozoic times	talk	CGU	Canadian Geophysical Union	2015-05-07	"Montreal, Canada"		"Whether the tectonic processes seen today at plate boundaries are analogous to those on the young, hotter, more ductile Earth of the early Precambrian is still widely debated. Extensive slab melting and other Archean processes, such as the extraction of komatiitic magmas, caused large-scale lithospheric depletion, resulting in a buoyant cratonic core able to survive multiple Wilson cycles. The cratons are characterized by a thick (>200km), seismically fast keel, which is readily identified on tomographic images. The Laurentian keel beneath North America does not fit easily within the Archean model of formation; the lithospheric root is thought to persist beneath both the Superior craton and the younger Proterozoic Grenville province in southeast Canada, suggesting that keel formation may not have been restricted to Archean times. In order to address this issue we present a P and S wave relative arrival-time tomographic study using data from seismograph networks in SE Canada and the NE US, stretching from the southern tip of Hudson Bay within the Superior craton to the coastal Phanerozoic Appalachian terranes. The tomographic images display three broad zones of increasing mantle wavespeed from globally Òslow"" in the Appalachian terranes, to a Òfast"" Grenville Province and Òextremely fast"" Superior craton. We observe a linear low-velocity feature resulting from modification of the Laurentian keel by the passage of the Great Meteor hotspot. This feature is progressively offset southwestward with depth, potentially due to viscous coupling with mantle flow. No major plate-scale underthrusting during the Grenville Orogeny is apparent, in contrast to the Trans-Hudson and present-day Himalayan orogen. Our results support the developing consensus that keels form in two stages: a chemically depleted core of Archean age followed by a thermally developed, less-depleted lithosphere during Proterozoic times, highlighted by an abrupt wavespeed contrast in the tomographic images."

Subduction Beneath Laurentia Modified the North American Craton Edge: Evidence from P and S-wave Tomography 	poster	AGU	American Geophysical Union	2015-12-14	"San Francisco, US"		"Cratons, the ancient cores of the continents, are the longest-lived parts of Earth's surface that have survived thermal and mechanical erosion during multiple Wilson cycles. They are visible in tomographic images due to their thick (>200km), seismically fast keels or roots. The Laurentian keel beneath North America is intriguing since its root is thought to extend beneath both the Archean Superior craton and the Proterozoic Grenville province thus implying that keel formation may not have been restricted to Archean times. In order to address this issue we present a P and S wave relative arrival-time tomographic study using data from seismograph networks in SE Canada and the NE US, stretching from the southern tip of Hudson Bay within the Superior craton to the coastal Phanerozoic Appalachian terranes.

Our result therefore may have fundamental implications for the nature of the Grenville orogenic collision and cratonic stabilization of North America The results also support the developing consensus that keels form in two stages: a chemically depleted core of Archean age followed by a thermally developed, less-depleted lithosphere during Proterozoic times, highlighted by an abrupt wavespeed contrast in the tomographic images.Ê"

From cratonic modification to asthenospheric interaction: Body wave tomography of the North American cratonic margin	poster	BGA_PGRiP	University College London	2016-09-01	"London, UK"		"The most stable, long-lived features on Earth are cratons. They form the cores of the continents that resist the destructive forces of plate tectonics due to their thick (~250km) cold, buoyant, chemically-depleted lithospheric keels. Keels are readily identifiable in seismic tomographic images due to their fast wavespeed, but their formation and long-term stability remains under scrutiny. To address this issue, I have used P- and S-wave relative arrival-time tomography in southeast Canada, a region that stretches from the Archean Superior Province to the Phanerozoic Appalachians Mountains at the Atlantic coast. The tomographic images display three broad zones of increasing mantle wavespeed from globally Òslow"""" in the Appalachian terranes, to a Òfast"""" Grenville Province and Òextremely fast"""" Superior craton. The decrease in seismic wavespeed from Archean to Proterozoic domains across the Grenville Front is consistent with models of two-stage keel formation, supporting the idea that keel growth may not have been restricted to Archean times. However, while crustal structure studies suggest that Archean Superior material underlies Grenvillian-age rocks up to ~300km SE of the Grenville Front, our tomographic models show a near-vertical boundary in mantle wavespeed directly beneath the Grenville Front. We interpret this as evidence for subduction-driven metasomatic enrichment of the Laurentian cratonic margin, prior to keel stabilization. Variable chemical depletion levels across Archean-Proterozoic boundaries worldwide, may thus be better explained by metasomatic enrichment of Archean material than an inherently less-depleted Proterozoic composition at formation. The challenge now is to embed regional tomographic models for Canada in global scale models that better- constrain absolute wavespeed variations. I am doing this using the method of Li et al (2008). This is enabling me to look deeper into the mantle, and for the first time in this region, study the extent of the Farallon slab and lithosphere-asthenosphere interaction. "
Tectonic processes bounding the Superior Craton: Body wave tomography of the North American shield	poster	AGU	American Geophysical Union	2016-12-12	"San Francisco, US"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm16/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/130233	"Cratons are EarthÕs primordial geological features. They are thought to have withstood multiple Wilson cycles over their >2.5Ga history, in part, due to their thick lithospheric keels that are buoyant, strong and chemically depleted. Recent studies have shown that cratons may not be entirely indestructible however and often display post-formation modification signatures, particularly at their margins. The Superior craton of SE Canada is an ideal locality for study as within a few hundred kilometers, one encounters geology that spans three quarters of EarthÕs history. Whilst lithospheric keels are characterized by high seismic wavespeeds, younger tectonic processes may also manifest in present-day wavespeed variations and thus are detectable seismically. Here we combine the latest USArray dataset with data from permanent stations in SE Canada by using a uniquely developed data processing tool, to reliably convert relative to absolute arrival-times. Our data is set within the high-resolution continental portion of the global tomographic inversion of Burdick et. al., (2014). This affords a well-refined mantle model beneath SE Canada, a region that has traditionally lacked station coverage. Our tomographic model shows a sharp craton edge beneath the Grenville Front, suggesting that the North American craton was modified by subduction zone interaction. Consequently, post formation modification rather than variation in iron depletion levels at the time of formation may better-explain variations in wavespeed between Archean and Proterozoic terranes worldwide. Global constraints provide improved resolution in the deeper mantle, thus we are able to reliably map the extent of Farallon slab beneath SE Canada for the first time. We also may image the SW shift in the base of the North American craton, supporting the view that cratons are not entirely stagnant features over geological time and that present day asthenospheric flow can impact the evolution of cratonic keels."
New Insights into the Geological Processes that Formed Eastern North America derived from a cutting-edge Seismological Imaging Technique	talk	SSCP_DTP	Frontiers in Natural Environment Research 	2017-08-25	"London, UK"		"The cores of the continents are known as the cratons. These extremely stable parts of EarthÕs surface are often over 2 billion years old and thus have survived multiple plate tectonic cycles (Wilson cycles) that successively form and destroy supercontinents. These regions are bordered by geologically younger Òmobile beltsÓ, which shield the stable cratons from collisions with other tectonic plates. The 1 billion year old Grenville Province of North America stretches from northeastern Canada to Mexico and forms the bounding terrain to the east of the largest craton on Earth, the Superior. This has been favourably compared to the modern-day mountain building events (orogenesis) that are forming the Himalayas as India collides with Tibet to the north. Many local-scale geological and geophysical studies have proposed theories for the formation and subsequent evolution of the Grenville Province, yet little consensus exists. However, the recent deployment the USArray transportable array of seismograph stations and developments in processing techniques enabling the inclusion of data from small seismic networks in continental to global studies (Boyce et. al., 2017) means that we are able to seismically illuminate, for the first time, the mantle wavespeed structure for the entire footprint of the Grenville Orogen. Using these images it will be possible to understand better how the Grenville Orogen formed during the collision of Amazonia and Laurentia at 1Ga, more specifically, which tectonic processes were dominant. Recent work worldwide has shown that these Òstable regionsÓ can in fact undergo post-formation modification. Evidence for this exists in SE Canada however it has as of yet not been observed along the entire eastern margin of North America. This work aims to uncover these signatures of modification and unify competing theories for the formation and evolution of eastern North America."
Insights into the tectonics of the Eastern North American Shield at the Macro-scale: A new Absolute P-wave Tomographic Model for North America.	talk	BGA_PGRiP	University of Aberdeen	2017-08-31	"Aberdeen, Scotland"		"The Grenville orogen is a 1Ga old, 4000km long tectonic collision zone that bounds the North American Shield to the east, often drawing comparisons to the modern-day Himalayas in collisional style and extent. Local studies of the Grenville province are legion, however it remains enigmatic at the macro scale due to its large spatial footprint (from Labrador to Mexico), interaction with Phanerozoic tectonics and present-day sedimentary cover. Recently, the USArray Transportable Array seismic stations have gone someway to addressing this issue but station coverage remains sparse in global absolute wavespeed models in the shield regions further north. However, the newly published method of Boyce et. al., (2017) enables data from regional seismic networks to be incorporated into these global models. Here we use this method to add ~13000 new P-wave arrivals from stations in Canada to the continental portion of the global absolute wavespeed tomographic model of Burdick et. al., (2017). Thus we are able to seismically illuminate, for the first time, mantle seismic structure for the entire footprint of the Grenville Orogen. Recent work suggests that in SE Canada the edge of the Superior craton has undergone post formation modification. Using these images it will be possible to investigate whether craton edge modification is ubiquitous along the entire Grenville front and whether oblique or direct Òhead-onÓ shortening was dominant during the collision of Laurentia and Amazonia at ~1Ga. Through further comparison with the GLimER 2D receiver function profiles (Rondenay et. al., 2017), we aim to unify theories from local scale studies for evolution of the eastern portion of stable North America. Furthermore, we will be able to constrain the morphology of the North American keel and assess to what extent this may influence present day asthenospheric flow fields and the resulting implications for modification of the cratonic root."

African Cenozoic hotpot tectonism: new insights from continent-scale body-wave tomography	poster	AGU_AFR	American Geophysical Union	2017-12-15	"New Orleans, US"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm17/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/279755	"The African plate is an ideal study locale for mantle plumes and Cenozoic hotspot tectonism. On the eastern side of the continent, the uplifted East African and Ethiopian plateaus, and the 30Ma Ethiopian Traps, are widely considered to be the result of the African Superplume: a broad thermochemical anomaly that originates below southern Africa. Precisely where and how the superplume traverses the mantle transition zone is debated however. On the western side of the continent, the Cameroon Volcanic Line is a hotspot track with no age-progression; it is less easily attributed to the effects of a mantle plume. Central to our understanding of these issues is an improved picture of mantle seismic structure. Body-wave studies of African mantle wave-speed structure are typically limited to regional relative arrival-time studies that utilize data from temporary seismograph networks of aperture less than 1000km. The resulting tomographic images are higher resolution than continent-scale surface-wave models, but anomaly amplitudes cannot be compared from region to region using the relative arrival-time approach: the 0% contour in each region refers to the regional, not global mean. The challenge is thus to incorporate the often-noisy body-wave data from temporary seismograph networks into a continent-scale absolute delay-time model. We achieve this using the new Absolute Arrival-time Recovery Method (AARM) method of Boyce et. al., (2017) and the tomographic inversion approach described by Li et. al., (2008). We invert for mantle wavespeed structure using data recorded since 1990 by temporary networks in the Atlas Mountains, Cameroon, South Africa, East African Rift system, Ethiopia and Madagascar. Our model is well resolved to lower mantle depths beneath these temporary networks, and offers the most detailed picture yet of mantle wavespeed structure beneath Africa. The contrast between East African and Cameroon mantle structure suggests multiple development mechanisms for hotspot tectonism across the African continent."

The internal structure of the African superplume; insights from body-wave seismic tomography and converted phases	poster	AGU	American Geophysical Union	2018-12-14	"Washington, D.C., US"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm18/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/349601	"Originating below southern Africa, the African superplume, is a ubiquitous observation in global seismic tomographic images as a broad thermochemical anomaly. It is widely considered to have caused the ~30Ma volcanism at the Ethiopian traps and uplifted plateaus of eastern Africa. However, exactly how and where this feature crosses the mantle transition zone is debated. Further, internal heterogeneity within the plume itself has not been unambiguously observed, features predicted following studies of the south Pacific superplume. Key to resolving these issues are detailed seismic tomographic images and localised short-wavelength observations from converted seismic phases. Continental-scale surface wave imaging is lower resolution than regional body-wave studies of the mantle beneath Africa. The often-noisy data derived from these temporary networks of <1500km aperture, is routinely processed using relative arrival-times but these datasets cannot be combined across the entire African plate due to the loss of the mean background velocity structure. The development of Absolute Arrival-time Recovery Method (AARM) method of Boyce et. al., (BSSA: 2017) allows incorporation of P-wave data from all networks that have operated since 1990 in the Atlas Mountains, Cameroon, South Africa, the East African Rift system, and Ethiopia into the most up-to-date continental absolute delay-time P-wave mantle tomographic model for the African continent. Our model is well resolved to lower mantle depths beneath these temporary networks. We also present a new compilation of receiver function stacks that help constrain topography of sharp discontinuities above the south African LLSVP within the superplume."
Probing the Impact of Multiple Upwellings on the African Mantle Transition Zone using Converted Seismic Phases	poster	UKSEDI	Study of Earth's Deep Interior	2019-05-09	"London, UK"		"The African continent is largely void of recent subduction but is thought to be underlain by multiple distinct thermochemical upwellings that may originate below the mantle transition zone. Most notably, the African superplume, is widely considered to have caused the ~30Ma volcanism at the Ethiopian traps and uplifted plateaus of eastern Africa. Internal heterogeneity within the superplume below the mantle transition zone has not, as yet, been unambiguously observed, a feature predicted following studies of the south Pacific superplume. Further, numerous other distinct loci of Cenozoic volcanism throughout Africa are often linked to more localised upwellings, but this remains uncertain. Africa therefore presents an ideal setting to investigate the impact of thermochemical upwellings on the mantle transition zone to understand the dynamics of mantle upwellings in a continental setting. Key to better understanding these issues are localised short-wavelength observations from converted seismic phases. Here we present a new compilation of P-to-s receiver function stacks derived from publicly available seismograph networks across Africa from 1990 to the present day. We capitalise on a new high-resolution P-wave absolute velocity model for the African continent (Boyce et al., in prep.) to migrate our receiver functions to depth. Our consistent, continent-wide data processing and quality control procedure enables direct comparison between adjacent regions/tectonic environments. Our results will be used to constrain potential scatterers above the African LLSVP, within the superplume, and map discontinuity topography beneath Africa."

The Variable Seismic Signatures of Upwellings in the Transition Zone and Mid-mantle beneath Africa	poster	AGU	American Geophysical Union	2019-12-11	"San Francisco, US"	https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm19/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/502628	"The African superplume, is widely considered to have caused the _30Ma volcanism at the Ethiopian traps and has frequently been linked to other distinct loci of cenozoic volcanism across Africa. The contribution of more localised upwellings to African volcanism, that may or may not originate below the mantle transition zone is the subject of considerable debate. Observations of seismic discontinuities from the mantle transition zone and deeper within the mid-mantle can provide insight into the variable thermochemical nature of upwellings beneath Africa, that can be reconciled with their surface expressions. Here we present observations of seismic discontinuities beneath Africa obtained from a compilation of P-to-s receiver functions derived from publicly available seismograph networks across Africa from 1990 to the present day. We capitalise on a new high-resolution P-wave absolute velocity model for the African continent (Boyce et al., in prep.) to migrate our receiver functions to depth prior to common conversion point stacking. Our results illuminate a heterogeneous mantle transition zone beneath the East African and Main Ethiopian rifts. Preliminary results also indicate a seismic conversion from _1000km depth beneath the East African rift, co-located with slow wavespeeds associated with the African superplume, suggesting the presence of a mid-mantle phase transition within the plume material. These observations support the view that more than one mantle upwelling of variable thermochemical nature has contributed to recent volcanism in east Africa."

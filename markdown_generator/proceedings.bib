@inproceedings{Kim:2011ve,
	abstract = {This paper reports on some new results from the analyses of the video microscopy data obtained in a prior
experiment on two-dimensional (2D) colloidal crystals. It was reported previously that optical tweezers can be used
to create mono- and di-vacancies in a 2D colloidal crystal. Here we report the results on the creation of a vacancyinterstitial
pair, as well as tri-vacancies. It is found the vacancy-interstitial pair can be long-lived, but they do
annihilate each other. The behavior of tri-vacancies is most intriguing, as it fluctuates between a configuration of
bound pairs of dislocations and that of a locally amorphous state. The relevance of this observation to the issue of
the nature of 2D melting is discussed.},

@inproceedings{Kannam:2013ua,
	abstract = {One promising path for future drug screening technologies is to examine the binding of ligands to target proteins at the single molecule level by passing them through nanometer sized pores and measuring the change in pore current during translocation. With the aim of evaluating such technologies we perform virtual experiments on the translocation of proteins through silicon nitride nanopores. These simulations consist of large scale, fully atomistic models of the translocation process that involve steering a test protein through the nanopore on a timescale of tens of nanoseconds. We make a comparison between theoretically expected and simulated values of the current drop that is seen when the protein occupies the pore. Details of the stability of the protein and the preservation of its function as measured by its secondary and tertiary structure will be presented to validate both the simulation results and the fundamental design of the proposed device. Finally, the results will be placed in the context of experimental work that combines nanofabrication and microuidics to create a high throughput, low cost, drug screening device.},

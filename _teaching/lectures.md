This is a list of lectures I have given on climate economics and climate science applied to human responses to extreme weather events and climate change at the University of Oxford, Princeton University and the United Nations University.


Como Training School on Compound Events (2022)
------
Led a group project together with [Dr. Radley Horton](https://people.climate.columbia.edu/users/profile/radley-m-horton) on modeling pathways linking compound extremes and human displacement in the context of the 2022 Pakistan floods. 
<br> [project description](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pvSD3Lmpsru_ti9vFfQEVU2NPDA96xps/view)
<br>Students were provided with a hands-on application of the concepts of the [CLIMADA](https://wcr.ethz.ch/research/climada.html) economic modeling tool. 
participants and lecturers.

Attribution Science (2018-2021)
------
Several guest lectures and applied projects for Master students of the [Environmental Change and Management](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/graduate/msc-ecm/) course. Introduction to attribution science with exercises using the KMNI [Climate Explorer](https://climexp.knmi.nl/start.cgi).

Geography Taster Day (2020)
------
I also enjoyed conducting a participatory class experiment and the lecture that I gave on educational migration for Year 12 students of under-represented backgrounds during the 2020 Geography Taster Day at my college, Christ Church (Oxford University). 

Dryland migration webinar (2019)
------
United Nations University, Drought Impacts: Migration

The webinar investigated the interlinkage between drought and migration, exploring how drought affects vulnerability and the ability of communities to cope with the impacts of drought, [details here](https://grow-globedrought.net/webinar/drought-impacts-i-migration/). A recording can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEll0hJVEmc).

UNIQ Summer School (2018 & 2019)
------
Introduction to the [CLIVAR VACS Climate Atlas](https://www.clivar.org/panels-and-working-groups/africa/vacs).
A memorable guest seminar was one that I taught on "CLIVAR VACS Climate Atlas" to a class of prospective undergraduate students at the School of Geography and the Environment in Oxford as part of the UNIQ summer school (see photo).

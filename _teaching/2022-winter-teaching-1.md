Anonymous Student Evaluations

"Lalit is my favorite TA I've had at UCLA. He does a great job engaging everyone in the discussion and making sure everything is understood, I really like that when he asks someone something that they aren't sure about he gives them the chance to look it up and goes back to them later, this really helps everyone engage in the discussion and he doesn't just hand out answers. He always has a fun and engaging attitude and took the time to learn each of our names. In regards to his teaching, I have no complaints and he always gave great examples during class and was available for any questions we had as well. If I have the chance I will definitely take another class with him as the TA! Thank you Lalit!" 

"Lalit was a great TA, he really expanded on course material and definitely ensured that students were engaged and involved. His in-person discussions were very interactive and I appreciate how in-depth he delved into topics. His sections really helped me understand and review some concepts. Overall a great TA and super knowledgeable about the course material."

"I really enjoyed the memes on the slides. I thought they were funny and made information easy to remember. Thanks for a great section!"

"My TA did a really good job at explaining material and clarifying."

"My TA was very caring, nice, and knowledgable. I appreciated his flexibility and perseverance through covid changes."

"I liked that all materials from section were posted so we could review them later. Lalit is a great TA, and although I did not take advantage of the discussion opportunities as often as I should have, I heard only wonderful things about his attitudes towards student learning and his flexibility around student need. AMAZING TA!"

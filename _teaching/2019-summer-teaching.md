I was a volunteer cum teaching assistant at the ACM-W Summer School on Algorithmic Game Theory. The summer school was organized by ACM and [Dr. Neeldhara Misra](http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~neeldhara/) at IIT Gandhinagar from 2<sup>th</sup> July 2019 - 14<sup>th</sup> July 2019.

I was responsible for making transcripts of all the lectures/tutorials held in the 10 days of the summer school. A sample of the transcript can be checked [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11HyZiMSR1F6UDyTCFZJzMlIRtPMgqkJD/view?usp=sharing). A fellow TA also contributed for making the transcripts. The transcript cover the broad topic of Matching. Some of the topics included are *Stable Matching, Gale-Shapley Algorithm, Cheating Strategies, Hospital Residents, and Popular Matching.* If interested, you can also have a look at the practice problems covered during lecture review session.

I helped engineering students with problems, concepts and theory related to Eletromagnetism.

The course was given by Professor Marcos Vinicius Borges Teixeira Lima. His personal page for these lectures was [http://fma.if.usp.br/~mlima/teaching/4323203_2020/4323203_2020.html](http://fma.if.usp.br/~mlima/teaching/4323203_2020/4323203_2020.html).

In this course I guided approximately 20 students per semester through 7 laboratory experiments to enhance their understanding of how astronomers study the origins of life on Earth. These experiments included topics in geology labs, emission and absorption spectra, habitable zones, and more. Students also completed a semester-long 'Eco-Zone' project where they create and track a closed system over the course of 3 months to identify how the inclusion/exclusion of different materials aided in the various cycles necessary for life on Earth. In this project, students worked together to write a paper explaining their experiment and findings as well as a presentation delivered to the class. This project was an avenue for me to teach students about technical writing and conveying information through data visualization.

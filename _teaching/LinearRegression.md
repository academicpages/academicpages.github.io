Abstract
======
A dataset from Kaggle is collected on the relationship between individual medical expenditure and several mutually independent factors. Based on this dataset,
we analyzed the relationship between factors, such as age, BMI, and healthcare
expenditures. We further developed a regression model based on simple linear
regression approach. A simple linear regression is conducted on the nonsmoker
category which achieves an accuracy of 0.9 on the test set to be in the prediction
interval. The smoker category is separated into the high-charge group and low charge group. Multiple linear regression is conducted on both groups. The R square
scores are both over 0.9. Finally, it is concluded that the health expenditure of all
populations is linearly related to age, and the effect of BMI on health expenditure
varies with or without smoking.

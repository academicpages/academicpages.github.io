Demonstrated for 2nd year undergrads safety in the lab, encouraged them to apply what they had learned in lectures to real-world electronics.

Details of the experiment
======
Students were to follow a lab script and build a basic AC to DC variable benchtop power supply. Next they were to improve DC supply using an amplifier and diode circuit to smooth the output. Finally, for extra-credit, they were tasked with building the same system/circuit with a more advanced chip that did all of the previous work in one small package.


Time Requirements
======
I was required to run one lab per week, for 3 weeks per group, then mark their lab book within 2 weeks of handing in. Overall I dealt with 6 groups in total, each containing 20+ students.

Experience
======
This demonstation position helped improve my communication skills and lead the students to figure the answer on their own, without explicitly explaining everything. I learned the joy of teaching those who want to be taught. Working in a team of demonstrators allowed us to better manage the needs of the students and direct our attention to where it was needed most.

Jose is our machine operator for the welding and corner cleaner stations. His abilities are valued, as he goes above and beyond contributing to the quality and integrity of our product and our team.  Jose has a great ability to identify imperfections in assembly as well as processes, and this allows us to continuously move forward, always improving. His pride in his work is reflected by the quality of work he presents, as he takes a personal responsibility for our finished product; A quality I hope is always contagious.

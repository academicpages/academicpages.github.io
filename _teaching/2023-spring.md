Guest lecturer

(Feb 24, 2023)

### Slides
* I added some annotations to the slides we did not have time to cover.
* I deleted some things that were not explicitly discussed and may cause confusion without explanation.
* Please let me know if you want the original slide, but there's not much changes.

### Codes
* When you try in the beginning it should look much messier than this. I cleaned and rewrote the code for the class' purpose.

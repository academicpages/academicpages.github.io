Abstract
======
Data analysis and algorithms have come to play
an extremely important role in the football
industry today. Big clubs look to gain a competitive edge on and off the pitch, and big data
is allowing them to extract insights to improve
the club management, recruitment strategy
and their commercial efficiency. We study the
performance of teams and players in English
Premier League from 2007 to 2017. In addition,
We take some English clubs as examples, for
which arbitrary transfer optimization strategies
will be presented based on data analysis.

This course treats the analysis, filtering and detection of signals influenced by linear time-invariant systems as they occur in typical mechanical and mechatronic applications. Signals will be considered in both deterministic and stochastic formulations. Special emphasis is put on discrete-time techniques that can be easily implemented in practice.

Fábio's teaching activities have focused on various aspects of hydrology, including hydrological modeling, hydropower structures, hydraulic design, and the mathematical foundations of water resources engineering. Lately, he has also served as an instructor for Curriculum Extension Activities, providing students with opportunities to engage in practical and applied learning experiences outside the traditional classroom setting. These activities often involve community outreach, social projects, internships, research projects, or collaborations with external organizations. In addition to his regular teaching responsibilities (listed below), he has conducted short courses and tutorial classes in various educational institutions worldwide.

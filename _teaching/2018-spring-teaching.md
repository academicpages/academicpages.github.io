I worked as a teacher in all courses in themathematics, such as algebra, arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry and statistics at the Triax Academy. The students were applicants to the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. In addition, I taught to students of the first semesters of the University in the area of mathematics: Mathematics for Economists I and II, Basic Mathematics and Statistics in the same academy.

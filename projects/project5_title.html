                Clio offers a comprehensive suite of cloud-based solutions designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of law firms and legal professionals, including payment processing, customer relationship management (CRM), case management, and document automation software. <mark>Lawyaw</mark> is the <mark>legal document automation software</mark> within Clio suite that helps attorneys save time by automating their document creation and management processes. <br><br>

                Upon joining the Lawyaw team at Clio, I discovered their slow, error-prone, and inefficient in-person onboarding process which incurred a <mark>high customer acquisition cost</mark> of over $8,000 per week. Furthermore, customers felt overwhelmed and rushed during these sessions, struggled to understand product features, and often <mark>sought help from customer</mark> support, leading to <mark>some churning their subscription</mark>. <br><br>

                As a Product Manager at Clio, I worked on a project to replace Lawyaw's in-person onboarding process with an intuitive self-serve approach. I aimed to achieve <mark>three objectives</mark>: <br><br>

                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 02.</span> At least 70% of customers who experience our new onboarding process should report being satisfied or very satisfied with their overall experience.</li>

            <p>As a product manager, I took a systematic approach to delivering value to customers and achieving business goals through the creation and management of products. My process usually contains identifying market needs, defining product strategy, developing product roadmap, and overseeing product development and launch, as well as monitoring product performance and making necessary improvements to ensure long-term success.</p>

            <h6>Understanding the current onboarding process</h6>
            <p>To begin the project, I held several meetings with our onboarding team as well as our leadership to gain a deeper understanding of our current onboarding process and challenges our team was facing, as well as to learn more about our customers and their backgrounds. After this meeting, I was able to better visualize the process and understand our customers' journey. Below, I visualized the overal picture of our customers' journey.  </p>

            <h6>Understanding the customers pain points duirng in-person onboarding</h6>
            <p> After obtaining a clearer understanding of our current process, my first step was to review feedback and comments from customers about their onboarding experiences. Subsequently, I <mark>conducted 11 remote interviews</mark> with customers who underwent Lawyaw's onboarding process in the previous two months. The goal was to identify any pain points or challenges that emerged during the in-person onboarding process. </p>

            <p>
            After conducting each interview, I extracted relevant data from participants, identified key points such as observations, comments, and design ideas, and used them to create an affinity diagram. This diagram enabled me to present my findings to various stakeholders throughout the study and break down a complex onboarding issue we were experiencing in our onboarding process into more manageable categories.

             I also created multiple personas to give our users file and help team members feel connected to team. Creating personas also helped to get everyone in our team on the same page by encouraging all team members to think about the same persona, instead of each individual working toward his/her own vision of who the end user is.

            After identifying the user's needs and prioritizing them, I spent time sketching out the user journey and mapping their experience using a tool called Balsamiq. Then, I communicated the findings and user journey to our design team to ensure that the product we created met our user's expectations and aligned with their needs. I then collaborated with a designer on our team to finalize the product's design.

            Once we had the initial design, I had multiple meetings with the engineering team to break down different components and features into smaller, manageable tasks and estimating the time it would take to complete each task. I then prioritized these tasks based on their importance and dependencies, ensuring that the most critical tasks are completed first. I worked really closely with our engineering team to ensure that the timelines are feasible and achievable, and to identify and mitigate any potential risks or roadblocks that could delay the project.

            <p>
            To ensure that our final product meets the highest quality standards and satisfies the needs of our target audience, I facilitated a dogfooding session where every team member was asked to test the new onboarding process for three days. Moreover, to encourage thorough testing and bug reporting, I introduced a prize for the team member who identified the maximum number of unique bugs and issues. <br><br>

            This strategy served two crucial purposes: <strong>1)</strong> <mark>enabling team members to gain hands-on experience with the new feature</mark> and <strong>2)</strong><mark>providing valuable feedback and insights into potential issues or bugs, which allowed for proactive resolution before launch.</mark>

            <h6>Soft Launch</h6>
            <p>To ensure that our new onboarding process was effective and ready for a wider release, we conducted a trial with 10 new customers, gathering feedback and testing the product. After the onboarding process, I interviewed each of these customers for 15 minutes to collect their feedback on the experience. Additionally, I checked to ensure that the data we collected during the trial was properly stored in our databases. This allowed us to evaluate the success of the new process and make any necessary adjustments before rolling it out to a larger audience. </p>

                <h6 class="variant">Our main learning from the soft launch:</h6>
                <ul class="itemInstructionGroup">
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 01.</span> <mark>Decrease free trial period to increase sense of urgency:</mark> By decreasing the duration of our free trial period, we can instill a sense of urgency in potential customers and motivate them to take action sooner, resulting in a higher conversion rate and ultimately boosting our revenue.  </li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 02.</span> <mark>Provide in-person consultation on demand:</mark> A couple of customers expressed concerns about eliminating in-person training altogether. Offering a 30-minute consultation service (if needed) to customers concerned about eliminating in-person training can address their roadblocks and increase satisfaction, while also boosting our conversion rate. </li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 03.</span> <mark>Enable flexible trial period:</mark> Initially, we had a fixed free trial period of 14 days, but some customers requested an extension due to time constraints preventing them from reviewing all materials in that timeframe. To address this feedback, we provided the sales team with the option to extend the trial session for engaged customers who show a high potential for conversion. By offering this flexibility, we can accommodate the needs of our customers and improve our chances of converting them into paying customers. </li>

            <h6> Tracking product success </h6>
            <p>
            On February 7, 2021, we launched our new onboarding process. To gauge the effectiveness of this new feature, we implemented a variety of strategies and utilized different methods to track its success:</p>

                <ul class="itemInstructionGroup">
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 01.</span> <mark>Mixpanel data visualizations:</mark> I used the Mixpanel tool to visualize various metrics over time, including cancellation rate, bounce rate, the quantity of users who requested 1-1 training, and other relevant data points.  </li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 02.</span> <mark>Fullstory sessions:</mark> I sued the FullStory tool to analyze user interactions and identify pain points by observing their behaviors while going through the onboarding process. </li>
                      <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 03.</span> <mark>Survey:</mark> Users were prompted to complete a <a href="https://survey.survicate.com/05452484677a0688/?p=anonymous" target="_blank" class="note-link">satisfaction survey</a> to gauge their satisfaction level with their onboarding experience. </li>

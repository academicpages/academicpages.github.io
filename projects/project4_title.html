            </div>

            <h6 class="variant">About</h6>
            <p class="variant"> Oral presentations often have predefined time limits that speakers should not exceed out of respect for the audience’s time and the following schedule of events. However, the cognitive challenges of dividing attention with the secondary pacing task and the social pressure of maintaining a level of engagement with the audience mean that presenters may not be able to fully attend to their timing while they are speaking. Previous approaches to presentation timing support have also failed to control talk pacing and time overruns adequately. <br><br> 

            During my internship at Microsoft, <mark>I worked with a cross-functional team</mark> to explore how a mobile application could support all stages of the presentation time management process, from planning and refinement to rehearsals and delivery. This project <mark>won honorable mention award</mark> at MobileHCI conference and was presented as a fully-functional <mark>demo in Techfest, Microsoft's yearly event that covers internal cutting-edge research projects</mark>.

            <h6><span>Understanding Attitudes to Timing Support through Q-Methodology</span></h6>
            <p>
                We used <mark><a href="https://ebn.bmj.com/content/25/3/77"target=_blank">Q-methodology</a> </mark> to understand potential users' attitudes towards presentation timing support. We recruited 20 participants with experience giving timed talks at formal events.  <br><br>


                In the first stage, participants read each statement, asked the experimenter for further explanations if necessary, then provisionally assigned the statement to one of three groups: agree, neutral, and disagree. This familiarized the participant with all statements and began the process of differentiation. Participants were allowed to explain their reasonings when assigning the satatements to a particular group.

                    </li>
                </ul>

                In the second stage, participants arranged all statements in a forced distribution table according to the personal significance of the statements in their own experiences.

            <h6>Design</h6>
             <h6><span>High-fidelity Prototype</span></h6>
            <p>Below, I describe how we translated our design goals into concrete features of a mobile application called TalkZones. This Windows Phone application communicates with a Microsoft PowerPoint Add-In over Bluetooth, synchronizing time data in the XML of the .pptx file format allowing the same presentation to be paired with any mobile device. TalkZones also provides the high-level capabilities of time planning, time feedback, and remote control of the PowerPoint slideshow. 

            <p>Please read our paper <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/mhci0285-saketA.pdf" target="_blank" class="note-link">[here]</a> for more information about design decisions made while designing and developing our solution. </p>

            <!-- <p>We set out to explore the potential of mobile devices for presentation timing support, and we concluded that mobile phones are sufficiently flexible to satisfy the needs of different presenter types in a single form factor (e.g., as a handheld remote control and/or a remote timing display, giving passive visual feedback and/or active haptic notifications). Additional screen real-estate on the mobile phone can also help all presenters to set time targets while authoring slides, as well as attempt to follow them in rehearsals that closely anticipate the conditions of the final presentation delivery.<br><br> -->

                </li>
            </ul>

         <!--    We designed a lightweight and flexible approach to time target setting. The user creates time zones as an implicit side effect of assigning a duration or milestone to a slide. Each slide is initially represented as a row in a table that contains columns for the slide index and buttons with which to set the duration or cumulative time milestone of a zone ending on that slide. Tapping either of these takes the user to a time picker control with which they can specify the time period. A zone can be further subdivided by selecting a slide within it or deleted by tapping the cross icon. Usage patterns are free to vary from setting the durations of each slide  to setting milestones that indicate impending and actual “time up”, as well as supporting the progressive refinement of targets. For example, the user might first set milestones for high-level zones (e.g., 3 sections to finish after 5, 10, and 15 minutes), and then refine these into lower-level slide zones by specifying the durations (e.g., refining the 10-15 minute zone into two zones of 2 and 3 minutes, respectively). <br><br>

            In our target-setting screen, zones are automatically assigned colors in a reverse spectrum from violet to red. This progression is familiar, uses the widest range of discernable colors, and conveniently represents progress towards the “hot” end of the talk. Using zone coloring during delivery, color can provide a glanceable indication of the current zone and the approximate progress through the talk. Iterative rehearsal of a talk and the delivery of multiple talks over time should serve to reinforce this color mapping and accelerate processing of progress made. We also offer late coloring – a binary color scheme in which red and blue signify lateness and timeliness according to a blue=cool=on-time and red=hot=late metaphorical mapping. We chose this in preference to a traffic light metaphor since green=speed-up and red=slow-down is contradictory in the context of speaking to presentation slides, and confused users in pilot tests. Red and blue caused no such problems. While zone coloring gives feedback about where in the talk the presenter is, late coloring provides a simpler indication of how the presenter is doing with respect to time targets. -->

            <h6>Evaluation</h6>
            <p class="evaluation-text">Our evaluation of TalkZones spans <mark>two related studies</mark>. The goals of the first study were to understand how participants choose to configure and use TalkZones under various scenarios, and to compare the performance of TalkZones to that of a regular timer for controlling the pace of a short talk. The second study built on the first by testing how well TalkZones could pace longer talks with speakers’ own slides. </p>


            <h6><span>Study 1: Presenting Short but Interrupted Talks</span></h6>
            <p class="marginbottom"> We employed a <mark>between-subject</mark> design because familiarization with materials and timing strategies in one condition could impact performance in the other condition. We recruited 24 participants with experience in giving timed presentations were recruited, half of whom used TalkZones after training and preference elicitation, while the other half used a minimal TalkZones application as a regular countdown timer. User preferences were collected using a deck of 20 slides with prompts, such as "My home town" and "My university life". We then provided the following instructions for participants:

            <p>
                <ul class="itemInstructionGroup">
                  <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 01.</span> Speak continuously and maintain good eye contact (as recommended in the presentation literature). </li>
                  <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 02.</span> Miss early targets by longer times, but gradually catch up (to experience the feeling of recovering from being late). </li>
                  <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 03.</span> Gradually move back to the longest glanceable distance (to discover the potential of mobile timing display). </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            We preconfigured a talk time limit of 6 minutes 40 seconds. This corresponds to the total time available in the Pecha Kucha talk format of presenting 20 slides, each of which automatically advances after 20 seconds. This format was invented to tackle the problem of presenters overrunning in talks whose allocated time was already longer than needed to communicate the core message. The use of auto-forward is “all important” because “There’s no ‘next slide’ or ‘go back one, please’ at PechaKucha Nights”. Presenting so many slides in such a short time without the use of auto-forward creates a high level of time pressure from the outset, making it an ideal format to test our visualizations. Following these sensitizing experiences, we invited participants to experiment with the option of late coloring (red for late, blue for not late, regardless of the section) as well as the use of handheld control and haptic feedback. <br><br>

            Our findings showed that completion times in the TalkZones condition ranged from a 25s underrun to a 35s overrun, with a mean overrun of 8s (SD: 18s), or 2% over the target completion time. In contrast, participants using a regular timer in the control condition all ran over by 25-220s, with a mean of 1m49s (SD: 1m11s), or 27% over the time limit. A Welch’s t-test revealed a significant difference (t(12.7)=4.87, p<.0001, Cohen’s d=1.97), <mark>translating to a 14× improvement with TalkZones</mark>. Overall, participants reported that <mark><i>“it is easy to divide each section [zone]”</i></mark> and that the <mark><i>“smaller goals”</i></mark> of zone targets helped them to <mark><i>“quickly notice the remaining time”</i></mark> when considering slide transitions. When overrunning in a zone, the adaptively <mark><i>“shrinking space”</i></mark> of future zones helped participants to “pre-manage” their timing before it was too late, resulting in a <mark><i>“sense of security”</i></mark> and feeling of control.

            </p>

            <h6><span>Study 2: Presenting Longer but Shortened Talks </span></h6>
            <p class="marginbottom">The second study evaluated whether TalkZones' effectiveness for pace control in short talks could also transfer to longer talks under time pressure. Eight participants with backgrounds in science and engineering, who had not participated in earlier studies, were recruited. They were instructed to prepare a 30-minute presentation and then asked to give the presentation in just 20 minutes to simulate time pressure situations commonly faced in real-world scenarios.<br><br>

            In their timed talks, the mean and maximum overruns corresponded to 2% (23s) and 10% (2m3s) of the 20 minute time limit, again highly consistent with the 2% and 9% mean and maximum overruns from the first user study. From these results, <mark>we can conclude that TalkZones is an effective means of timing support for short-to-medium length presentations. Taken together, our results suggest that mobile phones are a suitable platform for presentation timing support, and that our TalkZones application gently encourages presenters to advance slides before it is too late to recover, even under the adverse timing conditions of short and shortened talks</mark>.

            <p class="variant">
             We worked with infectious diseases specialists at UC San Diego for 19 months to improve the process of adjusting data grouping criteria, which is a crucial operation in data visualization. Popular visualization tools offer automatic grouping of data, but further customization of grouping criteria can be challenging, often requiring multiple parameter adjustments. Our proposed solution, developed through collaboration with specialists, is now deployed and utilized by many specialists at UC San Diego Hospital.

            <h6>Background</h6>
            <p>
            Our motivation for this work comes from a 19-month collaboration with infectious diseases specialists at the University of California San Diego. We are designing and building solutions to support exploratory analysis of HIV data. Researchers use multiple univariate distribution graphs to investigate demographic, social, clinical, and geographic factors impacting HIV transmission. Adjusting groupings is a highly iterative process using different tools and programming languages including R, SAS, and ArcGIS. <br><br>

            Infectious diseases specialists find the current interaction model for adjusting groupings cumbersome, time-consuming, and occasionally error-prone. Current tools require writing and executing scripts or going through multiple GUI widgets on a separate control panel. This process is frustrating for researchers who frequently update and adjust groupings according to their evolving interest in data.

            <h6>UX Process</h6>
            <p>Keeping the end-users at the center of our design process, we worked closely with infectious disease specialists at the UC San Diego hospital for 19 months to design an innovative solution that was tailored to the user’s needs.

            <h6><span>Identifying Users' Challenges and Needs</span></h6>
            <p>Taking a <mark>user-centered approach</mark>, we began the design process with a grounded investigation of our users and their current practices, needs, and challenges. We <mark>conducted interviews</mark> with four infectious diseases specialists in San Diego County who had several years of experience researching HIV transmission. We reached empirical saturation with four participants, and during our interview sessions, we asked a set of questions listed below.
            </p>

            </ul>

            <p>Then, we freely continued our conversation that touched upon the tools, analytic methods, and challenges they face during the process.</p>

            <h6><span>Competitor Analysis</span></h6>
            <p>We conducted <mark>competitor analysis</mark> alongside the interviews to investigate commercial data visualization tools' ability to adjust data grouping criteria. We excluded tools that did not support adjustment of data groupings from our initial list of nine. Using a series of questions, we analyzed the remaining tools to determine the minimum number of steps required to adjust data groupings and how the tools supported this feature. Our analysis revealed that existing tools enable users to adjust data groupings through programming or layers of menus on control panels. Tableau was found to require the fewest steps among the existing competitors.</p>

            <h6>User Needs & Pain Points</h6>
            <p class="marginbottom">We actively took notes during these interviews with infectious diseases specialists. We then read through our notes to obtain a general sense of the data and thinking about organization of the challenges these specialists encountered. After reading the notes, we identified the meaningful text segments and assigned a code word or phrase that accurately describes the meaning of the text segment (e.g,. “the large number of steps”). The coding process was an iterative process with three passes by two coders in which the coders developed and refined the codes.</p>

            <p class="para-text">As a result of this process, we found that these specialists currently use different set of tools and programming languages including R, SAS, ArcGIS, and Tableau. We also identified three challenges pertaining to data grouping adjustment:</p>

                        <p>Some of the existing tools (e.g., ArcGIS) needed specialists to go through a series of menus that are spatially far from the main visualizations to adjust data groupings. Specialists found this model of interaction challenging
                            because they had to constantly shift their attention from the visual features of interest when adjusting the groupings.</p>

            <h6>Design</h6>
            <p>Based on the challenges raised by the infectious diseases specialists, we iteratively created different designs that would address the challenges. Among four design alternatives considered during our design process, two of the designs best
                met the challenges initially encountered by the researchers.
            </p>

            <h6><span>Low-fidelity Prototype</span></h6>
            <p>Our first design uses an in situ pop up to enable users to change the number of groups (first row) and merge and split numerical and categorical data (second and third rows). This design supports adjustment of grouping by enabling users to
                merge and split the groups interactively. As users adjust the grouping, the visualization will be updated to provide feedback.
            </p>

            <ul class="high-fidelity">
                <li>
                    <img src="../assets/images/design1.png">
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p>In our second design, direct interaction with visualization eliminates the need for external menus and dialogues and completely removes the spatial offset between visualization and visual glyphs. It supports adjustment of grouping by enabling
                users to merge and split the groups interactively. Finally, this design provides immediate feedback as user manipulate the visual glyphs representing a group.
            </p>

            <ul class="high-fidelity">
                <li>
                    <img src="../assets/images/design2.png" style="width: 87%;">
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p> In meetings with infectious diseases specialists, two designs for adjusting data grouping criteria were reviewed using paper prototypes. The first design was not seen as a considerable improvement compared to current tools, while the second design was well received as it required no additional menus or widgets. One specialist commented that the second design was <mark><i>"more organic and straightforward."</i></mark>  </p>

            <h6><span>High-fidelity Prototype</span></h6>
            <p>

                As a next step, we created a high-fidelity prototype of the second design using JavaScript, HTML, CSS technologies.

            <h6>Evaluation and Findings</h6>
            <p class="evaluation-text">The Avantgarde prototype was evaluated by conducting <mark>contextual inquiries</mark> with five infectious diseases specialists at the UC San Diego hospital. The participants were asked to use Avantgarde for 45 minutes to perform a data analysis session using the familiar HIV dataset while thinking aloud. The study concluded with a follow-up interview to gather feedback about the EMS technique.</p>

            <p class="marginbottom">Overall, all specialists who participated in this study found the EMS technique easy to use and effective in performing tasks related to adjustment of data grouping criteria. However, a few of them experienced difficulties in selecting very
                small and overlapping visual glyphs.</p>

            <p>After designing and testing our designs several times, we integrated our proposed technique to Avantgarde, a visual data analysis tool currently deployed and used by a significant number of infectious diseases specialists at the UC San Diego

            <h6>Key Takeaways</h6>
            <p>Overall, we were very satisfied with the way this project turned out. We took the user-centered approach to design a novel interaction technique that enables infectious diseases specialists to adjust data grouping criteria easier. Moreover,
                we were able to integrate our technique to Avantgarde, a visual data analysis tool currently deployed and used by a significant number of infectious diseases specialists at the UC San Diego hospital.
                <br><br> We also presented our technique at the IEEEVis conference (the premier forum for advances in visualization and visual analytics).

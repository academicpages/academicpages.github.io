            <h6 class="variant">About</h6>
            <p class="variant"> Lawyaw platform is a legal document automation software that helps attorneys save time by automating their document creation and management processes. When I joined the Lawyaw company, one of our main challenges was the high churn rate for our platform. Over 50% of our customers canceled their subscriptions in one or two months after signing up. So, our main goal was to investigate root causes of these early cancelations.

            <h6>User Research</h6>
            <h6><span>Understanding the customers pain points duirng in-person onboarding</span></h6>
            <p>
                Before starting the project we had several meetings with our cross-functional team to better understand the problem our team has been facing and to get a better sense of our customers and their background. We went through some of the comments/feedback we received from some of those who canceled their subscriptions (e.g., <mark><i>``I find the program too time-consuming''</mark></i>). We also discussed the roadblocks and challenges we were facing with our target users (e.g., attorneys overall lack of familiarity with computer-based technologies). These initial meetings helped me to have a better understanding of the customers, our goals, roadblocks, and expected deadlines. 
            

            <h6><span>Understanding the onboarding process</span></h6>
            <p>After learning more about the main onboarding challenges and our customers, I had a meeting with a couple of my team members in marketing and sales to better understand our onboarding process. My goal was to understand the steps that our customers go through from the subscription time until the cancelation. After this meeting, I was able to better visualize the process and understand our customers' journey. Below, I visualized the overal picture of our customers' journey. </p>

            <h6><span>Understanding user behavior over time</span></h6>
            <p class="marginbottom">
            At Lawyaw, we use softwares like MixPanel and Fullstory to monitor users’ interaction with our product over time. I investigated user interaction logs for 10 of our customers who canceled their subscriptions. My goal was to see if I could understand where in the process our customers faced challenges and what roadblocks they encountered that resulted in cancelation. Looking at user logs, what I noticed was that our customers tried creating legal templates using our tool, but they stopped in the middle of the process and did not complete the template creation. After trying multiple templates the customers came to a point (maybe a frustration point?) where they decide to cancel their subscriptions. This was showing us that something was not working as expected. Something was stopping our customers from completing their goals. Our hypothesis was that our customers were facing challenges somewhere in the middle of their process while using our product. This raised multiple interesting questions:    </p>

                <ul class="itemInstructionGroup">
                  <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 01.</span> Did our customers have difficulties understanding some of our features or designs? </li>
                  <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 02.</span> Did our platform behave in a way that our customers expected?  </li>
                  <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 03.</span> Did we provide enough tutorials and trainings for our customers during our onboarding? </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
         

            <p class="section-divider">
                ...
            </p>

            <h6>Talking to Our Ex-customers</h6>
            <p> To address the hypotheses and questions, we decided to conduct a few remote interviews with five of our ex-customers. We intentionally recruited participants who canceled their subscriptions in the last 1-2 weeks since their memory and experience with our product was still fresh. Our goal was to identify the root causes of these early cancelations. In particular we had a couple of main questions:</p>

            <ul class="questions">
                <li>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <div class="question-title">
                                <p data-name="01">What are the main challenges and difficulties in using our product? </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-md-6"></div>
                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <div class="question-title">
                                <p data-name="02">What are the issues and challenges in our onboarding process?</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            

            I started the interview by asking some easy warm-up questions (e.g., How did you learn about lawyaw?) to ease the participant into the interview. I then asked my main questions. Below, I listed some of the main questions that I asked during the main phase of the interview.

            <p>
                <ul class="itemInstructionGroup">
                  <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 01.</span> Do you mind walking me through your experience from the time that you subscribed to the time that you canceled?</li>
                  <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 02.</span> What phase of your experience with our product do you think was frustrating? Why? </li>
                  <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 03.</span> Do you mind walking me through some of your frustrations? </li>
                  <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 04.</span> How did the training process look like? </li>
                  <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 05.</span> Is there anything that we could do to improve this process?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
    
            
            After asking my main questions, I started wrapping-up the interview by asking some easy and general questions or summarizing the interview (e.g., any other thoughts? Any things else that I forgot to ask you?)

    
            <p class="section-divider">
                ...
            </p>
            <h6>Data Analysis</h6>
            <p>All interviews were conducted remotely using the Zoom software. I invited two other observers (members of our cross-functional team) to our interviews. Both observers were mainly responsible for taking notes during each interview process. After each interview, we had a debrief meeting among ourselves to gain a better understanding of the collected data, identify the meaningful customers’ comments, and clarify any ambiguities or misunderstandings. </p>

            After each interview, I took the data from each participant, pulled out the key points (observations, comments, and design ideas) to create an affinity diagram. The affinity diagram helped me to share my main findings to different stakeholders as the study progressed. It also helped me to break down a complicated onboarding issue that we had at Lawyaw into more specific categories.

            </p>
            <h6>Findings</h6>
            One of our main goals during our interviews was to identify when after subscribing to our product, the ex-customers felt frustrated. Our findings shows that our customers usually got frustrated at two phases during the entire process. <br><br>

            First, some of our ex-customers had a hard time to find our training material for a while after subscribing. Right after onboarding, our marketing team shares a few links to the training material through an email, but these links usually got buried through the emails. For example, one of our ex-customers mentioned: <mark> <i>``I did not even know that you have training videos! I expected a link to videos on your website or Lawyaw platform.''</i></mark> Our customers also faced multiple challenges related to the accessibility, discoverabiliuty, and quality of our training materials.

            Second, almost all participants found it challenging to work with some of the features in our platform (e.g., setting conditional logics in templates). Part of this frustration was related to the feature designs that were hard to discover and use. In addition, we did not have enough training materials to teach some of the advanced features. So, our ex-customers had to set up a call with our customer service to go through some of the more advanced features. As a result of these frustrations, customers decided to cancel their subscriptions. <br>

                <ul class="itemInstructionGroup">
                  <li><span class="itemInstruction"> 01.</span> We created a learning center called <a href="https://academy.lawyaw.com/" target="_blank" class="note-link">"Lawyaw Academy"</a>.

<!--     User-Friendly: The onboarding process should be easy to navigate, intuitive, and user-friendly. This means using simple language, clear instructions, and avoiding unnecessary steps.

    Personalization: Personalization of the onboarding experience can lead to higher engagement and retention. This can include personalized messages, suggestions, or recommendations based on the user's preferences, behavior, or profile.

    Clear expectations: The onboarding process should set clear expectations of what the user can expect from the product or service, and what they need to do to get started. This can include providing detailed instructions, FAQs, and best practices.

    Feedback: Providing feedback to the user during the onboarding process can help them understand how they are progressing, what they have accomplished, and what they need to do next. Feedback can also help users stay motivated and engaged.

    Self-Paced: Users should be able to progress through the onboarding process at their own pace, without feeling rushed or overwhelmed. Providing the option to skip certain steps or return to previous steps can also be helpful.

    Multi-Channel: Offering different channels to access onboarding resources can increase user adoption and retention. This can include tutorials, video guides, online help, and chatbots.

    Continuous improvement: Successful self-service onboarding should be an ongoing process. Gathering feedback from users and analyzing data can help identify areas for improvement, and ensure the onboarding process continues to meet the needs of users over time. -->

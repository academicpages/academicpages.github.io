    abstract = "As sentence-level performance in modern Machine Translation (MT) has plateaued, reliable document-level evaluation is increasingly needed. While the recent FALCON framework with pragmatic features offers a promising direction, its reliability and reproducibility are unclear. We address this gap through human evaluation, analyzing sources of low inter-annotator agreement and identifying key factors. Based on these findings, we introduce H-FALCON, a Human-centered refinement of FALCON. Our experiments show that, even with limited annotator consensus, FALCON achieves correlations comparable to or better than standard sentence-level protocols.Furthermore, we find that contextual information is inherent in all sentences, challenging the view that only some require it. This suggests that prior estimates such as ``n{\%} of sentences require context'' may stem from methodological artifacts. At the same time, we show that while context is pervasive, not all of it directly influences human judgment."

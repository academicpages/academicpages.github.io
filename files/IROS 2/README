IEEEtran.bst is the official BibTeX style for authors of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Transactions journals and
conferences. It also may have applications in other academic work such as
theses and technical reports.

IEEEtran.bst is a very comprehensive BibTeX style which provides many
features beyond the standard BibTeX styles - including full support
for references of online documents, patents, periodicals and standards.
See the provided user manual for detailed usage information.


 Enjoy!

    abstract = "We present IR{\_}Multi-agentMT, our submission to the WMT25 General Shared Task. The system adopts an AI-agent paradigm implemented through a multi-agent workflow, Prompt Chaining, in combination with RUBRIC-MQM, an automatic MQM-based error annotation metric. Our primary configuration follows the Translate{--}Postedit{--}Proofread paradigm, where each stage progressively enhances translation quality. We conduct a preliminary study to investigate (i) the impact of initial translation quality and (ii) the effect of enforcing explicit responses from the Postedit Agent. Our findings highlight the importance of both factors in shaping the overall performance of multi-agent translation systems."

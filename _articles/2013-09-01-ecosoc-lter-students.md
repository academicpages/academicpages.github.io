Abstract: In the pursuit to confront pressing environmental issues such as climate change, many scientists, practitioners, policy makers, and institutions are promoting large-scale ‘network-level’ scientific research that integrates the social and ecological sciences. To understand how this scientific trend is unfolding among rising scientists, we examined how graduate students experienced one such emergent social-ecological research initiative within the large-scale, geographically distributed Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network.

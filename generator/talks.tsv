2016-06-14	Talk	Administrative Support Bots in Wikipedia: How Automation Can Transform the Affordances of Platforms and the Governance of Communities	Communicating with Machines workshop	International Communication Association	Fukuoka, Japan		ica-communicating-with-machines	I discuss cases from a multi-year ethnographic study of automated software agents in Wikipedia, where ‘bots’ have fundamentally transformed the nature of the ‘anyone can edit’ encyclopedia project.	I discuss cases from a multi-year ethnographic study of automated software agents in Wikipedia, where ‘bots’ have fundamentally transformed the nature of the ‘anyone can edit’ encyclopedia project. Bots and bot developers have long been a core part of the Wikipedian community, and I studied how the development and operation of automated software agents intersected with the development of organizational and epistemic norms. My ethnographic project involved participant-observation in various spaces of Wikipedia: both routine editorial activity in Wikipedia (which is assisted through bots) and specific work in bot development, including proposing, developing, and operating a bot of my own. I also conducted extensive historical analysis of the history of Wikipedia, including case studies of bots throughout Wikipedia’s 15 year history. 
2016-06-11	Panelist	Drowning in Data: Industry and Academic Approaches to Mixed Methods in “Holistic” Big Data Studies	Annual Meeting of the International Communication Association (ICA)		Fukuoka, Japan		ica-drowning-in-data	This panel extends discusses the potentials and complications of mixed-methods research in big data studies, specifically in cases when population-level data is available.	In the past five years, as “big data” research increasingly has been adopted and adapted in the social sciences, the question of multimodal analysis pays a larger role in approaches and perspectives of research methodology. The buzzword "big data" has provoked critiques by a number of social scientists (eg., boyd & Crawford 2011; Bruns & Burgess 2012; Burrell 2012; Baym 2013; Lazer, et al. 2014; Tufekci 2014) on the theories, methodologies, and analysis of large data sources, and yet a growing number of scholars are experimenting with new ways to think about applying traditional and established methods to a newer domain and scale of data. Past panels (e.g., ICA 2013’s “Downsizing Data: Analyzing Social Digital Traces” and ICA 2014’s “Data-Driven Data Research Using Data and Databases: A Practical Critique of Methods and Approaches in ‘Big Data’ Studies”) have examined the practice of large-scale data analysis in social media research. This panel extends those discussions to look at the complications of mixed-methods research in big data studies, specifically in cases when “holistic,” population-level data is available.
2016-06-09	Talk	Successor Systems: Lessons for Big Data From Feminist Epistemology and Activism	Big Data: Critiques and Alternatives workshop	International Communication Association	Fukuoka, Japan		ica-successor-systems	I discuss four data-intensive activist projects as "successor systems," discussing the political and epistemological implications of using data to advance activist projects.	The concept of successor systems extends Harding (1987) and Haraway’s (1988) call for feminist “successor sciences” -- ways of knowing that critically blend objectivity with situatedness -- to the field of “Big Data.” I argue that successor systems involve a different form of data-intensive knowledge production, in which counterpublic collectives (Fraser, 1990) reflectively deploy algorithmic routines to build “a better account of the world” (Haraway, 579). I discuss four data-intensive activist projects as successor systems, discussing political and epistemological implications of such tactics. These successor systems have much to teach scholars and practitioners of “Big Data,” giving concrete and theoretical alternatives to the more dominant practices in academia and industry.
2016-06-08	Talk	Algorithms as agents of gatekeeping, governance, and articulation work in Wikipedia	Algorithms, Automation, and Politics workshop	International Communication Association	Fukuoka, Japan		ica-algorithms-gatekeeping	I discuss how algorithmic systems are deployed to enforce particular behavioral and epistemological standards in Wikipedia, which can become a site for collective sensemaking among veteran Wikipedians.	This talk is based on a multi-year ethnographic study of algorithmic software agents in Wikipedia, where bots and automated tools have fundamentally transformed the nature of the notoriously decentralized, ‘anyone can edit’ encyclopedia project. I studied how the development and operation of automated software agents intersected with the development of organizational structures and epistemic norms. My ethnography of infrastructure (Star, 1999) involved participant-observation in various spaces of Wikipedia. I discuss how algorithmic systems are deployed to enforce particular behavioral and epistemological standards in Wikipedia, which can become a site for collective sensemaking among veteran Wikipedians.

2015-11-12	Talk	The Bot Multiple: Unpacking the Materialities of Automated Software Agents	Annual Meeting of the Society for the Social Study of Science (4S)		Denver, CO		4s-bot-multiple	I examine the roles that automated software agents (or bots) play in the governance and moderation of Wikipedia, Twitter, and reddit – three online platforms that differently uphold a related set of commitments to ‘open’ and ‘public’ online participation.	This paper examines the roles that automated software agents (or bots) play in the governance and moderation of Wikipedia, Twitter, and reddit – three online platforms that differently uphold a related set of commitments to ‘open’ and ‘public’ online participation. While bots are often discussed as malicious or fake agents (e.g. ‘socialbots’), the bots I discuss in these three platforms are more or less legitimate social actors, delegated substantial authority in autonomously enforcing norms and policies. These bots extend and modify the functionality of sites like Wikipedia, Twitter, and reddit, and are generally developed and deployed by volunteers on their own time – continuously operated on computers that are independent from the servers hosting the site. These governance bots involve alternative relations of power and code, requiring that we go beyond studying software code in order to unpack the sociomaterial configurations at work in such digitally-architected spaces. Instead of taking for granted the pre-existing stability of these sites as unified platforms, bots require that we examine the concrete, historically contingent material conditions under which this code is run. Reporting from a multi-sited ethnography of infrastructure, I demonstrate several ways in which bot development comes on the scene in relation to broader assemblages of server farms, platform code, federated databases, code repositories, issue trackers, application programming interfaces, terms of service, mailing lists, counterpublic groups, and a variety of other entities. I argue that bots give us a compelling set of cases for exploring the multiple materialities at work in highly-distributed online spaces.

2015-05-25	Talk	But it Wouldn’t Be an Encyclopedia; It Would Be a Wiki: Wikipedia and the Repurposing of WikiWikiWeb	Annual Meeting of the International Communication Association (ICA)		San Juan, Puerto Rico		ica-wiki-history	In this talk, I examine the early history of “anyone can edit” wiki software -- originally developed in 1995, six years before Wikipedia’s origin -- focusing on the ways in which this technological infrastructure has been repurposed across communities, domains, and scales.	In this talk, I examine the early history of “anyone can edit” wiki software -- originally developed in 1995, six years before Wikipedia’s origin -- focusing on the ways in which this technological infrastructure has been repurposed across communities, domains, and scales. While today, the idea of a wiki is associated with large-scale, massively-distributed encyclopedic knowledge production, this was not always the case. As I show, many of the assumptions and practices in pre-Wikipedia wiki communities contradicted the idea of a universal repository to document the sum total of human knowledge. In fact, the title of this presentation comes from a conversation between Wikipedia’s co-founder Jimmy Wales and Ward Cunningham, the creator of the first wiki, who advised Wales that the goals of creating a general-purpose encyclopedia and a wiki might be inherently contradictory. As Wales, Sanger, and other early Wikipedians used Cunningham’s wiki software to produce a collective encyclopedia, they found themselves constantly modifying the wiki platform, incorporating features and affordances that supported the kind of encyclopedic knowledge production they found themselves engaged in. Many of these novel features -- such as a persistent history of edits to articles, separate discussion pages for individual articles, and citations/references -- are now taken for granted aspects of what it means for a wiki to be a wiki. Yet at the time, their existence was far more controversial and precarious. Using archival and software studies methods, I illustrate several ways in which wiki software was adapted for the specific purposes and practices of Wikipedians, departing substantially from the pre-Wikipedia understandings of what wiki-based collaboration is and ought to be. Beyond Wikipedia, this case shows how technological infrastructures intersect with particular configurations of communities, epistemologies, and ideologies. Focusing on how one particular infrastructure was re-used and repurposed for a rather different set of values gives us a useful case for problematizing technologically determinist narratives around media technology and society.

Collective action is often described in terms of the relationships, learning, principled processes, and community capacities it fosters. Despite this, human computation and collective action systems are often designed and evaluated with system outputs in mind: the quality of answers, the number of votes, the accuracy of content created. In this proposal, we review literature on the design values of “citizen-x” systems, put forward a series of models for describing the civic values in “citizen-x”, and classify systems by those models.

2014-05-23	Panelist	Data­-Driven Data Research Using Data and Databases: A Practical Critique of Methods and Approaches in “Big Data” Studies	Annual Meeting of the International Communication Association (ICA)		Seattle, WA		ica-data-driven-data	This panel focuses on the challenges faced by researchers conducting mixed-method research into online platforms, particularly where large amounts of data are widely available.	In the past two years, the buzzword "big data" has provoked critiques by a number of social scientists (eg., boyd & Crawford 2011; Bruns & Burgess 2012; Burrell 2012; Baym 2013) on the theories, methodologies, and analysis of large data sources. This panel follows up from last year’s ICA 2013 panel, “Downsizing Data: Analyzing Social Digital Traces,” and draws from the experiential grounded approach of Hargittai’s (2009) “Research Confidential” to bring to light practical critiques of the application of digital data research methods in the  study of social media platforms. Namely, the panelists will explore how social scientists can shift away from the rhetoric surrounding “big data” and robustly analyze the use of large-scale, computationally-driven, mixed-methods approaches in digital data research. Again, this panel will not discredit large-scale data approaches; instead, we aim to provide context to researchers who wish to employ them in combination with established methods in the field. The panel brings together five scholars to speak about their successes and failures working  on projects that employ large-scale digital data methods and tools, regardless of the size of the data, in addition to their iterative approaches dealing with the practicalities of data collection, sampling, theory, analysis, and especially results. Notably, these projects are not purely quantitative, analytical studies employing large datasets: all participants use largescale data and computational approaches within the context of empirical mixed-methods or even (traditionally) qualitative, interpretive studies. The panelists will also discuss the critical  approaches to “big data” that inhabit each project. These projects are all exemplars of an emerging mode of scholarship, and collectively they aim to generate a productive and concrete discussion about methodology and epistemology. After a framed introduction by the  moderator, participants will spend 10 minutes each to speak in detail about the methodologies of their projects, after which the latter half of the panel will open to discussion with the audience. This panel also will be paired with a Blue Sky Workshop, provocatively entitled “‘Big Data is Bullshit’: Scoping the Next 5 Years of Digital Data Research.” We aim to use the panel as an expert-driven, experiential methods presentation as well as a launchpad for topics and debates that can be further explored in the workshop session (which will occur at some point following the panel).

2013-11-25	Talk	Size Matters: How Big Data Changes Everything	Bangkok Scientifique		Bangkok, Thailand	http://www.meetup.com/bkksci/events/140639312/	bkk-data	A talk introducing various concepts around large-scale data analysis to a general audience, including spam detection and governmental survellance.	In the wake of all the rigmarole going on with the Snowden leaks and details of the NSA intelligence gathering apparatus, it's suddenly very clear to the average person just how much data is out there, and how difficult it must be to recognize, organize and filter it for a usable purpose. Even if we try to minimize our digital footprint, each of us nonetheless generates an incredible amount of data that represents US in the digital realm. To talk us through what systems are used to parse such vast quantities of data into a usable format, we are happy to welcome Stuart Geiger to this month's BkkSci. Stuart's current research is on the intersection of data science and artificial intelligence (AI) that is often branded as "Big Data." These systems collect massive, diverse, and complex data sets, and then use this data to teach computers how to identify patterns and make decisions. Stuart will talk about his work both in building these automated agents to support the production of knowledge, and in studying how these systems are changing how scientists, governments, businesses, and ordinary people like you and me come know the world.

2013-08-03	Conference proceedings talk	When the Levee Breaks: Without Bots, What Happens to Wikipedia’s Quality Control Processes? (with Aaron Halfaker)	International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration (WikiSym 2012)	ACM	Hong Kong	http://stuartgeiger.com/wikisym13-cluebot.pdf	wikisym-levee-breaks-bots	This paper examines what happened when one of Wikipedia's counter-vandalism bots unexpectedly went offline.	In the first half of 2011, ClueBot NG – one of the most prolific counter-vandalism bots in the English-language Wikipedia – went down for four distinct periods, each period of downtime lasting from days to weeks. In this paper, we use these periods of breakdown as naturalistic experiments to study Wikipedia’s heterogeneous quality control network. Our analysis showed that the overall time-to-revert edits was almost doubled when this software agent was down. Yet while a significantly fewer proportion of edits made during the bot’s downtime were reverted, we found that those edits were later eventually reverted. This suggests that other agents in Wikipedia took over this quality control work, but performed it at a far slower rate.

Many quantitative, log-based studies of participation and contribution in CSCW and CMC systems measure the activity of users in terms of output, based on metrics like posts to forums, edits to Wikipedia articles, or commits to code repositories. In this paper, we estimate the amount of time users have spent contributing. Through an analysis of Wikipedia log data, we identify a pattern of punctuated bursts in editors’ activity that we refer to as edit sessions. Based on these edit sessions, we build a metric that approximates the labor hours of editors in the encyclopedia. Using this metric, we first compare labor-based analyses with output-based analyses, finding that the activity of many editors can appear quite differently based on the kind of metric used.

In this paper, we first illustrate and describe the various defense mechanisms at work in Wikipedia, which we hypothesize are inhibiting newcomer retention. Next, we present results from an experiment aimed at increasing both the quantity and quality of editors by altering various elements of these defense mechanisms, specifically pre-scripted warnings and notifications that are sent to new editors upon reverting or rejecting contributions. Using regression models of new user activity, we show which tactics work best for different populations of users based on their motivations when joining Wikipedia.

In the past few years, there has been an explosion of academic researchers who are turning their attention towards Wikimedia projects. Hundreds of scholars representing virtually every discipline in the humanities, the social sciences, and the computational sciences have entered various Wikimedia communities to answer a broad range of questions using an equally diverse set of methods. As both researchers and editors have learned, actively studying wiki communities raises a number of problems and concerns, from the practical and logistical to the ethical and legal. Despite years of informal dialog and negotiation between individual researchers and editors, multiple WikiProjects dedicated to wiki research, and an ongoing attempt to craft a formal research policy, many issues are still unresolved.\n\nThe purpose of this panel is to foster a dialog between wiki researchers and the Wikimedia community on many of these issues, which include: Are talk pages, listservs, and IRC channels public spaces, and should researchers have to identify themselves when they enter? What kinds of privacy issues exist with reporting an editor’s actions in an academic article? Under what conditions should social scientists be allowed to send unsolicited requests to random samples of users, a process which has been sometimes been considered spam and resulted in the banning of researchers’ accounts? Are controversial 'breaching experiments' (such as vandalism response tests) of value, and is there a way they can be performed in a satisfactory manner? Should there be a group or committee that would review and approve certain kinds of academic research activities, similar to the Bot Approval Group? These are some of the many questions that will be asked, and audience members will be encouraged to participate in this discussion.

Lessons from Wikipedia’s bots speak to debates about how algorithms are being delegated governance work in sites of cultural production.	I present findings from a multi-year ethnographic study of automated software agents in Wikipedia. "Bots" and bot developers are a core part of the volunteer community that curates one of the world's largest and most popular information resources. The Wikipedian community relies on hundreds of independently run bots to monitor and regulate almost all aspects of the site. Bots are delegated a wide variety of organizational and administrative work, including: patrolling for spam, 'vandalism', and 'edit wars'; standardizing grammar, layout, citations, and units; updating articles using public datasets; and identifying more complicated work and distributing those tasks to humans. In my infrastructural inversion (Bowker & Star 1999), I argue Wikipedia can only appear to be governed by an economistic "wisdom of crowds" if the work delegated to bots remains invisible. These bots have long been a core way in which Wikipedians govern the 'anyone can edit' project in the absence of more formal organizational structures. Wikipedians also work out fundamental disagreements about what the encyclopedia and the community ought to look like by, in part, debating about how bots ought to be delegated governance work. For example, one of the more consistently raised (and rejected) proposals on the English Wikipedia is a bot that would make all articles conform to a single national variety of English. Lessons from Wikipedia's bots speak to many debates about how algorithmic agents are being incorporated into sites of cultural production, drawing our focus to the governance work that is delegated to automated information infrastructures.

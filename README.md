# Felipe's Personal Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal website. This site is a showcase of my professional work in neuroscience, computer vision, behavior, etc.

## Overview

The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It features information about my research, publications, teaching experience, and more. The base site is from [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).

## Structure

The website is organized into several main sections:

- **Home:** A brief introduction about me and my work.
- **Research:** Details about my ongoing research projects.
- **Publications:** A list of my academic publications.
- **Teaching:** Information about my teaching experience and philosophy.
- **Contact:** How to get in touch with me.

## Development

If you wish to run the website locally, you will need to have Ruby and Jekyll installed. Once those are installed, you can run the following commands in the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
cd yourrepository
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000` to view the site.

# Welcome

Hi, my name is Nicki and I do machine learning research. Currently I am a Postdoc at the
[Section for Cognitive systems](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english/research/research-sections/cogsys) at
Technical University of Denmark (DTU) where I work with Professor [Lars Kai Hansen](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~lkai/).
I consider myself a *jack of all trades, master of none* in machine learning and deep learning, having experience with
computer vision, NLP, supervised models, generative models, reinforcement learning ect. Current research interest are in
the intersection of efficient machine learning, designing of machine learning system and machine learning operations
(MLOps) in general. The last topic I also teach about in this [course](https://skaftenicki.github.io/dtu_mlops/) at DTU.

Furthermore, I am a core developer and maintainer of [Lightning AI](https://lightning.ai/), where we develop open-source
software to help researchers scale their models and experiments and not their boilerplate 😀

Feel free to contact me if you want to work with me.

  note={We propose a new representation learning algorithm to control parity of any decision algorithm. We theoretically establish that by limiting the mutual information between representations and protected attributes, we can assuredly limit the statistical parity  of any classifier. We demonstrate an effective method for controlling fairness through mutual information based on contrastive information estimators and show that they outperform approaches that rely on variational bounds based on complex generative models.},

  note={We propose a new architecture for BrainAGE prediction, which works by encoding a single 2D slice in an MRI with a deep 2D-CNN
  model and combining the information from these 2D-slice
  encodings by using set networks or permutation invariant lay-
  ers. Experiments on the BrainAGE prediction problem, using
  the UK Biobank dataset showed that the model with the
  permutation invariant layers trains faster and provides better
  predictions compared to the other state-of-the-art approaches.}

  note={We derive implicit gradients of the optimal logistic regression parameters with respect to the input training embeddings. Thus, we can train adversarial models without alternating min-max optimization, leading to better training stability and improved performance. We show the usefulness of this method for learning fair representation.}

  note={An approximate extension of fictitious play in continuous action spaces, DeepFP is proposed. DeepFP represents players’ approximate best responses with implicit density approximators and trains them with a model-based learning regime. We demonstrate stable convergence to Nash equilibrium on several classic games and in a forest security domain. DeepFP learns strategies robust to adversarial exploitation and scales well with players’ resources.}

We perform memory consolidation via generative replay of past experiences and demonstrate improved retention on task of learning from sequential non-iid examples.},

We demonstrate the potential to predict good defender strategies via experiments and analysis on discrete and continuous game settings.}

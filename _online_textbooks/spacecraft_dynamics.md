## Who might find the above link useful?
The above online textbook is most useful for QMUL's second year Aerospace Engineering undergraduate students taking
[EMS515U: Introduction to Spacecraft Dynamics](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/modules/items/ems515u-introduction-to-spacecraft-dynamics.html).
It could also be a useful resource for other educators interested in teaching orbital mechanics, especially using computational
tools like `numpy`.

## Personal Recommendation of Pre-requisites
This is my personal list of pre-requisites (not prescribed or stated as so by my employers):
1. An interest in space engineering.
2. Vector algebra and basic vector differentiation.
3. Deep familiarity of classical mechanics, especially as taught by me using symbolic modelling tools over [here](https://www.angadhn.com/ComputationalDynamics).

## Assessment Profile for QMUL course EMS515U
All assessments are conducted on the [JupyterHub platform provided by QMUL](http://hub.comp-teach.qmul.ac.uk).

Assessment is carried out through the following elements:
- A coursework on orbital mechanics. This is upto and includes the lecture notes on Special Orbits (40%)
- Final online exam in January assessment period (60%).

For students requiring resits, assessment is carried out through a reassessment written exam
in the LSR period (100%).

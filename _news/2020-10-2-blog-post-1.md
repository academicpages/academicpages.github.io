I am glad to annouce the publication of my first coursera guided project ["Finding bibliography metrics using the crossref API"](https://www.coursera.org/projects/finding-bibliography-metrics-using-crossref-api). This project makes it convenient for learners to analyze different bibliography metrics from different perspectives, such as impact and number of collaborators. 

In the past few years, I have been thinking a lot about how to make use of the data I have in Mendeley other than just read each individual paper. Can I get field developmental tendency out of this pile of papers? Are there any particular sub-topic in the field that is more impactful than others? If I have 99% papers in my field stored in my Mendeley, can I make predictions about which sub-field is going to be more impactful in the next 10 years? I learned about this useful package ['rcrossref'](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rcrossref/rcrossref.pdf) from my mentor Dr. Julien Brun during my 2019 summer data intern at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). When I was asked to decide on topics for the coursera projects, this package first came to my mind. 

Please feel free to comment under this post if you have any feedback for my project or if there is any particular R packages you'd like me to teach. I am also open to teach any open source softwares that could be helpful to researchers or useful to general public who are interested in science (i.e., citizen scientists). 

Hold on there. Have a nice weekend, everyone!

During the summers of 2017 and 2019, I was a public outreach volunteer in the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. While there, I developed and regularly ran a "cart program", where I would teach museum guests about dark matter using visual aids and 3D printed, hands-on tools. I also ran weekly solar observing sessions and supervised a local high school student in the development of another cart program and solar observing.

<b>Primality Testing: A Review</b> <br> 

<b>Paul, D.</b>, 2012.

## Abstract
<p>Primality testing was one of the greatest computational challenges for the the- oretical computer scientists and mathematicians until 2004 when Agrawal, Kayal and Saxena have proved that the problem belongs to complexity class P. This famous algorithm is named after the above three authors and now called The AKS Primality Testing having run time complexity O ̃(log<sup>10.5</sup>(n)). Further improvement has been done by Carl Pomerance and H. W. Lenstra Jr. by showing a variant of AKS primality test has running time O ̃(log<sup>7.5</sup>(n)). In this review, we discuss the gradual improvements in primality testing methods which lead to the breakthrough. We also discuss further improvements by Pomerance and Lenstra.

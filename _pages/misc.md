I like to play sports such as badminton and tennis, and I also like listening to songs in my spare time.

Recently, I started to write my Wechat Blog. [Here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jF3f3R8vkk8CMpqDf0QQIw) is an article about my semester in Harvard in Chinese.

I also published a Chat helper using OpenAI API [here](https://chat.jyi2002.com/). Please contact me if needed.

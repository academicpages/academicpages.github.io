Check out my creative work below. I have been making things my entire life, and have been selling some of them [on Etsy](https://realmsoflegend.etsy.com) since 2010. I also design knitting and crochet patterns, which you can find [on Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com/designers/emily-hastings) or in my Etsy shop. Once upon a time, I wrote a blog for my shop, which you can [check out](http://realmsoflegend.blogspot.com/) if you want a behind-the-scenes look at some of my projects.

You can help my make more cool things by supporting me on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/realmsoflegend): [![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/C0C1P0Z6)

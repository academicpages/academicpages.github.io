The author
======
Alberto Chierici is a data scientist, entrepreneur, and product manager. He has started and advises a number of innovative companies and has wide experience in data science. His love for technology led him to explore Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and eventually writing his first book about the intersection of AI and morality, _The Ethics of AI: Facts, Fictions and Forecasts_.

Alberto is passionate about AI, and seeks to develop products people love while improving their lives. He wants to help build a more compassionate and inclusive society by educating the public about the limits of science, technology, and data. When he isn’t working, you’ll find him at home with his wife and children, probably cooking something delicious.


The book
======
How often have you heard that we must fear an AI-driven apocalypse? That one day the robots will take over? That we will lose our freedoms and follow the leadership of a ruthlessly efficient overlord? This is what we hear on a daily basis, but is there any truth to those claims? 

_The Ethics of AI: Facts, Fictions and Forecasts_ seeks to explore those questions, and brings in the research of experts such as moral philosopher and author Jonathan Haidt, former lead of psychology at Cambridge Analytica Patrick Fagan and Charles Radclyffe, founder and CEO of the first rating agency for ESG/Ethical AI. Each chapter explores the fundamental aspects of AI and their history, challenging your perspectives on what AI is, and could become. We must keep pace with the rapid development of technology, placing morality and ethics at the forefront when scoping the development of AI applications.

_The Ethics of AI_ explores the intersection of AI, STEM, humanities and ethical formation. If you are a follower of modern technology, work with AI in any capacity or just love sci-fi references, this book belongs in your library.

  
Early praise
======
_"As the world progresses through our digital first innovation strategies, leaders all across the globe need to think about the implication of ethics and their own moral comapasses. Alberto provides a great blueprint in_ The Ethics of AI: Facts, Fictions, and Forecasts _for stakeholders in all arenas of AI development._

_"Navigating and understanding the implication of ethical choices in AI is not easy for technology developers. Alberto provides a great overview in_ The Ethics of AI _for innovators to understand the history, mystery and ongoing complexity with human choices in AI development."_

—Shay S, CEO Bluejarvis Technologies

_"Great job on writing such a well-thought-out book! I grew up in the Silicon Valley area, so I really enjoyed reading your research into the moral questions that artificial intelligence forces us to grapple with. I also appreciated the approach that you took to exploring these ethical quandaries; often, the more philosophical—or "human"—side is neglected in this discourse, and I thought your manuscript did a great job of bringing the STEM and humanities fields together to form a more balanced understanding of just how thoroughly AI impacts our daily lives. I look forward to seeing how technology leaders will use your research to develop more morally conscious implementations for AI!"_

_"Excellent book! A must-read for both AI experts and for people who’re just curious about the topic._

_The author, Alberto Chierici, raises attention to relevant questions around our interaction as humans with AI based tools._

_Thanks to a very clean and passionate writing style, the author allows us to reflect in a critical way on the potential benefits of AI for humans and its limits. To quote one of the inspiring parts of this book:_

'Data will always be a limitation of AI. ML programs can then automatically organize data into information, which can provide knowledge, but it is up to us humans to critically evaluate how information was generated and how to use it—wisdom is a human’s objective. We cannot leave the task of deriving wisdom to a machine.'

_Alberto is also an example of how a humanistic background (philosophy) and technical specialty (statistics, math, business logics) can create a wonderful model of a new job in the digital era."_

—Francesca G, CEO Assist Digital

_"I highly recommend this excellent book by author Alberto Chierici._

_"The author brings a very unique perspective about the topic. His curious mind is reflected in his writing which makes reading his book an enlightening experience. His background in math, statistics and computer science solidify his authority on the topic. And he makes understanding AI easier by breaking down jargon for non technical audiences using examples about technologies that we all know or use everyday._

_"In addition to his professional experience, Alberto is a father of an almost four years old daughter. I really enjoyed the example of the conversation with his daughter; teaching her a lesson in order to explain a machine learning concept._

_"If you have contextual knowledge about AI, then you'd appreciate learning it from someone who brings in a wealth of knowledge. I learned a lot from reading Alberto's book. And even if you know nothing about to the topic and want to learn about it, this book will make you want to google and learn some exciting stuff! Please enjoy!"_

_"A treasure chest of insight, understanding and explanation that will be of tremendous value for all who read it for many years to come._

_"This book brings together the 'best of the best' when it comes to understanding and explaining the impact of this technology and how it will touch every aspect of our lives for decades to come. It is exactly the right book that everyone should read to benefit from the opportunity that AI presents to us all."_

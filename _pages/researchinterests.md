I'm interested in **Planetary Atmospheres**. People have been curious about the exotic worlds, including 7 other planets in and over 4,000 planets out of our solar system. Their atmospheric conditions vary in a wide range in planetary orbit, gravity, composition, temperature, pressure and so on. These differences makes many of the known laws for our Earth's atmosphere unvalid, and thus requires people to re-study the atmospheres of these planets from the basic physics laws that can be universally applied.

Currently I'm mainly interested in 2 kinds of planets:
* **Gas Giants** (Jupiter, Saturn, etc.) <br>
  What will happen in the atmospheres where condensable species is heavier than back ground molecules? Convection seems to be suppressed, but there is yet more about moist convection in these atmospheres to explore! <br>

* **Earth-like Tidally-Locked Planets** (To determine the range of habitable zone)
  Strong convection near the sub-stellar area can significantly reflect back the sun light, reducing the incoming short-wave radiation and then lower the pace of temperature increasing with closer planet-star distance. <br>

summary: "Explainable Information Retrieval"
abstract: "This tutorial presents explainable information retrieval (ExIR), an emerging area focused on fostering responsible and trustworthy deployment of machine learning systems in the context of information retrieval. As the field has rapidly evolved in the past 4-5 years, numerous approaches have been proposed that focus on different access modes, stakeholders, and model development stages. This tutorial aims to introduce IR-centric notions, classification, and evaluation styles in ExIR, while focusing on IR-specific tasks such as ranking, text classification, and learning-to-rank systems. We will delve into method families and their adaptations to IR, extensively covering post-hoc methods, axiomatic and probing approaches, and recent advances in interpretability-by-design approaches. We will also discuss ExIR applications for different stakeholders, such as researchers, practitioners, and end-users, in contexts like web search, patent and legal search, and high-stakes decision-making tasks. To facilitate practical understanding, we will provide a hands-on session on applying ExIR methods, reducing the entry barrier for students, researchers, and practitioners alike.

This half-day tutorial is divided into two parts of 90 minutes each -- In the first part we explore the notions of explainable IR, probing neural models and explainable-by-design approaches. In the second half, we delve deeper into axiomatic IR and its connection to interpretability and some of the popular posthoc approaches.

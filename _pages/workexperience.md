**Coderhouse Startup (Argentina)** – _Data Scientist Instructor_
<br/>Sept, 2022 – Jul, 2023

- I assist students by providing theoretical and practical guidance.
- My tasks primarily involve tutoring in coding, teach end-to-end Machine Learning for customized projects, implementing MLOps (CI/CT/CD) best practices, and building APIs for ML models contanerized into Docker for deployment as microservice.

**Statkraft (Peru)** – _Freelance Data Scientist – Computer Vision Dev_
<br/>Sept, 2022 – Dec, 2022

- I developed an Intelligent Video Analytics (IVA) project focused on the inspection of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the identification of individuals at potential risk near high-voltage machinery. To achieve this, I utilized Python, along with advanced techniques such as Deep Learning, Computer Vision (including Object Tracking), YOLOv7, and DeepSort-StrongSort.
- I spearheaded a project focused on semantic segmentation to address water leakage in the cooling pipes of high-voltage machines. To achieve this, I used the U-Net architecture as both an encoder and decoder, effectively segmenting the water and identifying any instances of leakage within the pipes.
- I successfully deployed these models with OpenCV scripts on edge-computing devices like the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, as well as local servers, to ensure efficient data consumption and performance monitoring. This implementation followed the MLOps methodology for a streamlined workflow.
- I leveraged OCR, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning to automate the extraction of data from PDF invoices and images, facilitating financial balance processes within the commercial and accounting domains.

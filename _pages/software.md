## scBONITA: single-cell Boolean Omics Network Invariant Time Analysis

GitHub repository: [https://github.com/mgp13/scBONITA](https://github.com/mgp13/scBONITA)

- uses scRNA-seq data to infer Boolean regulatory rules for topologically characterized networks
- prioritizes genes based on their impact on signaling
- performs pathway analysis, and
- maps sequenced cells to characteristic signaling states of these networks

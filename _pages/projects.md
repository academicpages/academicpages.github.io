I study scalable methods to analyze and synthesize multi-agent systems with three specific research thrusts: 1) autonomy in adversarial environments, 2) bio-inspired swarm robotics, and 3) communication & control for collaboration.

# Autonomy in Adversarial Environment

As the large-scale deployment of multiple autonomous agents becomes more practical, maintaining security against adversarial autonomous swarms becomes important in both civilian and military defense applications. Driven by this motivation, I study multi-player pursuit-evasion games (PEGs), where I developed a decomposition method that reduces a complex problem into smaller tractable pieces.

* Decomposition method (circular & polygonal perimeter) [[CDC18](https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2018.8618879)]
* Extension to arbitrary convex shapes [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03989)]
* Team strategies and their optimality [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04342)]

# Bio-inspired Swarm Control

Biological swarms show how complex group-level behaviors can emerge from completely distributed local in-
teractions. I have studied the mechanism of such local interactions among swarming mosquitoes, and used
the insights I gained to design distributed algorithms for cooperative target pursuit.

# Communication and Control for Cooperation

Effective interactions between the components of a multi-agent system are essential in maximizing the overall performance. I studied effective communication strategies in terms of how to maintain connectivity and what information to communicate.

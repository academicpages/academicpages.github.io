Collaborated with classmates on a project exploring the intricate relationship between community walkability and various facets of well-being in urban environments, focusing on New York City neighborhoods.

## **Objective:**
Investigate correlations between walkability and well-being indicators, such as concentrated poverty rates and student obesity rates.

## **Methodology:**
Collected data on New York City walkability, poverty, and obesity. Utilized Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for preprocessing and visualization. Merged datasets for comprehensive analysis.

## **Results:**
No significant correlation between walkability and poverty. Identified higher obesity rates in less walkable New York City neighborhoods.

Collaborated with a classmate on a comprehensive project addressing CPU scheduling algorithms and process synchronization.

## CPU Scheduling Problem:
* Developed a CPU scheduler simulation with FIFO, SJF, and Priority algorithms.
* Utilized C++ to handle 541 simulated processes, addressing arrival time, CPU burst length, and priority.
* The problem incorporates well-documented code and sample input data files and produces detailed statistics for each scheduling algorithm.

## Process Synchronization Problem:
* Classmate led the development of the Producer-Consumer problem using Pthreads, with comprehensive testing and performance measurement.
* The solution is implemented in C++ and covers various scenarios, providing insights into overall turnaround time.

This project allowed us to delve into the intricacies of operating systems, applying theoretical concepts to practical problem-solving.

## [Population-Based Hierarchical Non-Negative Matrix Factorization for Survey Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.04968.pdf)
PHNMF is a novel variant of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization that discovers interpretable latent structure in subgroups that is suitable for a wide range of data types. We demonstrate the accuracy of PHNMF on synthetic datasets, as well as the utility of PHNMF for downstream inference.

## [Automatic Infectious Disease Classification Analysis with Concept Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02415)
We apply NMF to increase the interpretability of neural network applications. Particularly, NMF illuminates the discovery of concepts in medical imaging contexts. The utility of this concept discovery method on novel and emerging diseases is demonstrated through its application to monkeypox imaging.

## [BalanceProofs: Maintainable Vector Commitments with Fast Aggregation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/864)
We present a new vector commitment scheme that is maintainable with fast aggregation. Balanceproofs can transform non-maintainable vector commitment schemes into maintainable ones that also support fast aggregation. Finally, Balanceproofs offers flexibility to make tradeoffs between proof size, update time, and proof computation through the use of the "bucketing" technique.

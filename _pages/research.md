**[Firms as Tax Collectors](https://pablogarriga.github.io/files/firms-as-tax-collectors.pdf)** — *Accepted for publication at Journal of Public Economics*  
(with Darío Tortarolo)

- Winner of the [2022 ITAX PhD Student Award](https://www.iipf.org/itaxaward.html)
- Coverage: [World Bank Development Impact Blog](https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/improving-tax-administration-and-compliance-appointing-firms-withholding-agents)

<p align="justify">We study the implications of delegating tax collection duties on firms. We exploit a major reform to the withholding regime of the Turnover Tax in the City of Buenos Aires, where a substantial number of large firms were appointed to act as Collection Agents (CAs) based on a predetermined revenue threshold. Combining rich firm-to-firm administrative data along with quasi-experimental methods, we show that: (i) firms newly appointed as CAs do not experience any effects on their reported business activity; (ii) firms with pre-existing commercial ties to CAs increase their self-reported income; (iii) the government collects more tax revenue. Additionally, the analysis of a subsequent reform that reduced third-party collection of the tax shows that firms respond symmetrically by reducing their reported income. These results are in line with other papers suggesting that reforms to the tax administration can have a considerable impact when it comes to raising revenue and building tax capacity. In particular, our findings can provide guidance to other middle- and low-income countries on ways to determine who the right tax collector is as a function of the level of development.</p>

**[Corporate Responses to Size-Based Tax Rates in Lithuania](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099313106262317603/idu0e3c1b6c300a6c045390bb860c3c2931a384f)** — *World Bank Policy Research working paper n. WPS 10500*  
(with Thiago Scot)

- Winner of the [2023 ECA Academy](https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eca/brief/ecace-academy)
- Coverage: [World Bank Development Impact Blog](https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/burden-complexity-understanding-challenges-lithuanias-tax-system)

<p align="justify">This paper studies how firms respond to differential, size-based tax rates using administrative tax data in Lithuania. Exploiting a notch in the tax schedule faced by corporations, it documents strong behavioral responses to tax incentives—revenue elasticity is estimated at 0.35 and cost elasticity at -1.3, implying a large total profit elasticity of 7.4. It then leverages the panel structure of the data to provide insights on the dynamic effects of these tax incentives. Firms located close to but below the notch report systematically lower revenue growth in the short term, but the effects dissipate over time.</p>

**[The Impact of COVID-19 on Formal Firms: Lessons from Administrative Tax Data](https://pablogarriga.github.io/files/covid19-firm-impacts.pdf)**
(with Pierre Bachas, Anne Brockmeyer, Camille Semelet)

- Coverage: [Economics Observatory](https://www.economicsobservatory.com/how-does-lockdown-affect-firms-developing-countries) and [UCL Stone Centre](https://www.stone-econ.org/research/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-formal-firms-micro-tax-data-simulations-across-countries)
- We are currently updating the paper to compare our simulations to the realized impact of COVID-19

<p align="justify">How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting firm profits and tax payments in developing countries? This paper uses administrative corporate tax records from 10 low- and middle-income countries around the world to provide plausible estimates. Modeling the lockdown-triggered revenue shock with simple and transparent assumptions, the analysis predicts that less than half of all firms will remain profitable by the end of 2020, about 5–10 percent of the formal aggregate annual payroll will be lost, and firm exit rates will double. As a result, it is expected that tax revenue remitted by the corporate sector will fall by at least 1.5 percent of baseline gross domestic product. Differences in sectoral composition and firms’ cost structures generate heterogeneity in the results across countries: wage subsidies are less effective in low-income countries and government revenue losses are smaller.</p>

**[Robots, Exports and Top Income Inequality: Evidence for the U.S.](https://www.cedlas.econo.unlp.edu.ar/wp/en/no-307/)** — *CEDLAS working paper n. 0307*  
(with Andrés César, Guillermo Falcone) 

<p align="justify">The last decades have witnessed a revolution in manufacturing production characterized by increasing technology adoption and a strong expansion of international trade. Simultaneously, the income distribution has exhibited both polarization and concentration among the richest. Combining datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the International Federation of Robotics, EU KLEMS, and COMTRADE, we study the causal effect of industrial automation on income inequality in the U.S. during 2010–2015. We exploit spatial and time variations in exposure to robots arising from past differences in industry specialization across U.S. metropolitan areas and the evolution of robot adoption across industries. We document a robust positive impact of robotics on income for only the top 1 percent of taxpayers, which is largest for top income fractiles. Therefore, industrial automation fuels income inequality and, particularly, top income inequality. According to our estimates, one more robot per thousand workers results in relative increments of the total taxable income accruing to fractiles P99 to P99.9, P99.9 to P99.99 and P99.99 to P100, of 2.1 percent, 3.5 percent and 5.9 percent, respectively. We also find that robotization leads to increased exports to high-income and upper-middle-income economies, and that this is one of the key mechanisms behind the surge in top income inequality.</p>

**[Tax Filings vs Tax Withholdings: Behavioral Responses from Firms and Tax Preparers](https://pablogarriga.github.io/files/tax-preparers.pdf)**  
(with Darío Tortarolo)  

<p align="justify">We study the relationship between tax filings and tax withholdings for the Argentine Turnover Tax on businesses and we shed light on the role of tax preparers in that relationship. Firms file a tax return every month through a centralized online platform and can (i) claim a refund if the amount withheld in advance (third-party reported by suppliers and clients) exceeds the tax liability, or (ii) remit the difference if the tax liability is higher than withholdings. Using rich administrative data, we first document sharp bunching exactly at the point where tax liabilities (reported by the firm) equal tax withholdings (third-party reported) and argue that this pattern is due to strategic under-reporting of income so that the tax balance matches the withholding shown by the online platform. Second, by linking firms to tax preparers through shared contact information we study the role of accountants on this behavior. We analyze how correlated are the behaviors of firms who share the same accountant (network). We find a positive relationship between accountants and the bunching behavior observed on their clients. We also exploit information on past audits and show that, within a network, non-audited firms respond to their peer's audit, suggesting that tax preparers might act as diffusers of information across firms.</p>

**Firm Dynamics Along the Development Path**  
(with Pierre Bachas and Anne Brockmeyer)  

<p align="justify">We study firm-growth dynamics in developing countries and its macroeconomic implications. This area of study has been hampered by data limitations since most countries have only occasional manufacturing surveys or censuses at best. Consequently, while the literature has documented the existence of market distortions leading to limited firm growth, this evidence has been restricted to a small set of countries that have available data. In turn, this has also limited the possibility of gaining insights at an aggregate level. In this project, we harmonize and combine administrative tax data for multiple countries. This allows us to trace out within-country trends as well as gaining knowledge of firm dynamics along different stages of development.</p>

**Assessing the role of tax preparers in tax compliance: direct and network effects**  
(with Darío Tortarolo)

- Paused due to COVID-19

<p align="justify">Two understudied areas in Public Finance are the role of tax professionals and the role of networks in tax administration and enforcement (Slemrod, 2018). In this project we seek to answer two questions: First, whether it is more cost-effective to communicate tax preparers or taxpayers to improve tax compliance; Second, whether there are spillover effects from targeted to non-targeted taxpayers that form part of the same network (those sharing the same accountant). To that end, we run a large-scale randomized communication experiment where we send deterrence emails to taxpayers and/or accountants (about 100,000 taxpayers in the treatment group and 900,000 in the control group).</p>

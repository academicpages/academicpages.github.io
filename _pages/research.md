I am a PhD candidate at the Institute of Plant Biology, Biological Research Centre, Hungary and Vrije University, The Netherlands, supervised by [Dr. Petar Lambrev](http://www.brc.hu/en/research/institute-of-plant-biology/plant-light-perception-and-utilization-research-unit/photosynthetic-membranes-group) and [Dr. Ivo van Stokkum](http://www.few.vu.nl/~ivo/). Currently, I'm working at the [Photosynthetic Membranes Group](http://www.brc.hu/en/research/institute-of-plant-biology/plant-light-perception-and-utilization-research-unit photosynthetic-membranes-group),[Biological Research Centre](http://www.brc.hu/en).


My research work primarily explores on monitoring excitation energy transfer and trapping kinetics during the light-harvesting process of cyanobacterial photosynthesis. In our lab, we use various spectroscopic methods and data analysis tools to probe this rapid natural processes within photosynthetic organisims. You can find few of my completed projects here as a form of [publication](https://avratanubiswas.github.io/publications/). Always happy to chat more about my work, so please don't hesitate to reach out !

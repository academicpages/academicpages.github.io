### Work in Progress

- **"Should I Mail or Should I Go: Insights From a One-Time All-Postal Runoff Election"** (with V. Lindlacher) <br>
  Abstract: *We examine how eligible voters in Bavaria, Germany, change their voting behavior after some of them experience mail-in voting for their first time. Exploiting a natural experiment during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the runoff election in the 2020 mayoral election was an all-postal election, we employ an event study using municipality-level data. The findings indicate a robust but temporal positive effect on total turnout in the first subsequent election, with an increase of 0.5 percentage points, on average, as well as on mail-in turnout, with an increase of 1.0 percentage points. In-person voting is persistently shifted by 0.5 percentage points, on average, towards mail-in voting. The effect is stronger for small municipalities and for municipalities with a low voter turnout in the last federal election. These results contribute to the understanding of how citizens' behavior changes when more information about mail-in voting reduces cognitive costs and habit formation in terms of the voting mode.*

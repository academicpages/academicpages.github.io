In my research I use lab and field experiments to explore topics that include

- misspecified social learning
- discrimination and inaccurate beliefs
- rationalization and motivated reasoning
- student mental health stigma
- peer group support for tutors

## Work in Progress

- **“Mental Models, Social Learning and Statistical Discrimination: A Laboratory Study”**  
  <small>In economic decision-making, individuals often rely on subjective representation of the environment to process information and make inferences. Using a laboratory experiment, we investigate how such mental models transform when people are exposed to the evaluations of others, particularly in scenarios where one or more parties may adopt an incorrect or misspecified model. Participants face a hiring task where their goal is to choose a worker with higher ability by integrating a noisy education signal with prior group information. The design of treatment conditions variably exposes subjects to choices by another participant, using one group to present evaluations closely aligned with the theoretical Bayesian benchmark and another to expose subjects to evaluations from a participant exhibiting conservatism bias (signal neglect). We find that exposure to conservative choices leads to higher incidence of suboptimal behavior relative to exposure to Bayesian choices. Using elicited confidence measures and a diagnostic treatment with detailed feedback, we explore potential mechanisms. The results suggest that not recognizing the optimality of others’ choices partially hinders social learning. In addition, lower confidence in one’s choices is strongly associated with following others’ suboptimal actions, but not with learning from the optimal ones.</small>

- **“Stigma, Beliefs and Demand for Mental Health Services Among University Students”** with Ida Grigoryeva, Bruno Calderon, Roberto González and Alejandro Guardiola Ramires  
  <small>Despite high rates of mental health challenges such as depression and anxiety and the availability of effective treatment options, most university students do not seek professional help. This project examines the factors that shape the demand for mental health services among students, as well as the barriers that prevent them from seeking support. We conduct a representative survey at a large university in Mexico to establish baseline information on student mental health. Preliminary results indicate that nearly one-third of students report moderate or severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, yet most do not seek or receive adequate support, with only 40% of students in distress accessing professional help. Additionally, while students tend to believe that poor mental health correlates with lower grades, our data shows no evidence to support this. Our findings aim to inform interventions to reduce the mental health treatment gap in the university student population.</small>

- “Mental Models, Social Learning and Statistical Discrimination: A Laboratory Study”
In economic decision-making, individuals often rely on subjective representation of the environment to process
information and make inferences. Using a laboratory experiment, we investigate how such mental models
transform when people are exposed to the evaluations of others, particularly in scenarios where one or more
parties may adopt an incorrect or misspecified model. Participants face a hiring task where their goal is to
choose a worker with higher ability by integrating a noisy education signal with prior group information. The
design of treatment conditions variably exposes subjects to choices by another participant, using one group to
present evaluations closely aligned with the theoretical Bayesian benchmark and another to expose subjects to
evaluations froma participantexhibiting conservatism bias(signal neglect). We findthatexposure toconservative
choices leads to higher incidence of suboptimal behavior relative to exposure to Bayesian choices. Using elicited
confidence measure and a diagnostic treatment with detailed feedback, we explore potential mechanisms. The
results suggest that not recognizing optimality of others’ choices partially hinders social learning. In addition,
lower confidence in one’s choices is strongly associated with following others’ suboptimal actions, but not with
learning from the optimal ones.

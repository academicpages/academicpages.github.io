## Nuclear Transients & Extreme Accretion Physics 
 
Nuclear transients are a broad class of astronomical transients which occur in the nuclei of galaxies and are associated with transient accretion episodes onto supermassive black holes. They often have highly variable emission in many different wavelength bands, including X-ray, optical, infrared, and radio! These exciting objects allow us astronomers to probe extreme accretion physics around supermassive black holes.

### Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs)

When an unfortunate star wanders just a little too close to a supermassive black hole, the tidal forces of the black hole can exceed the star's self-gravity, leading to the star being torn apart and becoming an afternoon snack for a previously quiescent black hole. This leads to a flare of electromagnetic emission across a variety of wavelengths, allowing us to study these previously invisible supermassive black holes. Currently the field of TDE populations is exploding, thanks to cadenced all-sky surveys in the optical, infrared, and X-ray. I'm very interested in the wealth of different observed properties of TDEs -- for example, many optically-selected TDEs show no X-ray emission, or show very delayed X-ray emission. Understanding this dichotomy can help us probe the physical emission mechanisms; does optical emission arise from stream-stream collisiions, or the reprocessing of X-ray emission from the accretion disk?

In addition, I'm interested in understanding our observational biases in the detection of TDEs. To assess potential biases in the optical and X-ray selection methods, I'm currently working on a sample of infrared-selected TDEs from the WISE satellite. This sample should help us understand if the over-representation of TDEs in green valley galaxies is the result of an observational bias (e.g. dust obscuration) or something more intrinsic (e.g. increased TDE rates due to merging systems). This work will also provide a more accurate estimate of the TDE rates and help reconcile observatoins and theory.

### Changing-Look AGN

Nuclear transients can occur in actively accreting systems, too. In some active galactic nuclei (AGN), there are relatively "rapid" changes to the accretion state, marked by either the appearance or disappearance of broad emission lines in the optical part of the spectrum. The unified model of AGN suggests that whether or not we see broad emission lines in the optical spectrum is a consequence of our viewing angle to the nucleus; namely, broad lines are only seen if our sight line is *not* blocked by the dusty torus. However, changing-look AGN break this paradigm and do so much faster than we ever expected based on the standard viscous timescale in AGN (which sets the time it takes to propagate mass inwards and cause significant changes to the accretion flow). I'm fascinated by these systems and am working ot better understand what could drive such changes and how our X-ray view of the inner accretion flow can inform this.

During the first two years of my PhD, I worked on two particularly unique changing-look AGN. The first, 1ES 1927+654, is one of the weirdest AGN we know. It is first changing-look AGN that was caught in the act of changing states (as first presented in [Trakhtenbrot et al. (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...883...94T/abstract)) and the first AGN in which we witnessed the X-ray corona disappear (see [Ricci et al. (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898L...1R/abstract)). In [Masterson et al. (2022a)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...934...35M/abstract), I worked on understanding the full X-ray outburst from this system, spanning over three years in duration with hundreds of X-ray observations from many different observatories. We tracked the re-formation of the X-ray corona in this system and the evolution of a peculiar broad 1 keV emission line. This line can be modeled with relativistic reflection occuring in an optically and geometrically thick inner acretion flow, which fits in with the picture put forth by [Ricci et al. (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...898L...1R/abstract) that the corona was destroyed by a TDE occuring in the existing accretion disk.

The other intriguing changing-look AGN I've worked on is the candidate binary supermassive black hole AT2019cuk/Tick Tock/SDSS J1430. This source was first suggested to be a binary supermassive black hole within 3 years of merging by [Jiang et al. (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220111633J/abstract), based on a decreasing periodic signal in ZTF data and interesting optical broad line evolution. If truly a binary, this would be the first chance to witness an electromagnetic merger of two supermassive black holes, which is highly anticipated given the next generation gravitational wave detectors (e.g. [LISA](https://lisa.nasa.gov/)) and the highly uncertain electromagnetic emission in these events. However, after tracking this system for 8 months, we found no periodic behavior in X-ray, UV, or optical emission, thus challenging the binary hypothesis. The high-cadence NICER monitoring we performed (with ~2 observations per day every day for 8 months) revealed these repetitive and stochastic hard X-ray flares that have never been seen before in an AGN. We present these results in [Masterson et al. (2023b)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...945L..34M/abstract), and suggest three potential models for the flares, the most likely of which we expect to be the variable corona model, in whih the flares arise from intrinsic changes to the corona due to increased magnetization levels.

## High Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy of Nearby AGN 

During my Masters work at the University of Cambridge, I worked with data from the High Energy Transmission Grating on the Chandra X-ray Observatory to probe the narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line around nearby AGN. In [Masterson et al. (2022b)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...936...66M/abstract), we used three different spectral orders to disentangle the effect of velocity broadening (which is constant across different spectral orders) and spatial extent (which primarily effects the lower order spectra). This new technique provides unique constraints on the location of the emitting material, which is nearly impossible to do with standard imaging techniques, even with the best resolution provided by Chandra. In the future, I'm interested in applying similar techniques with the new [XRISM](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/xrism-x-ray-imaging-and-spectroscopy-mission) mission.

## AGN Feedback and the Evolution of Galaxy Clusters

I am also broadly interested in how accretion can impact a black hole's surroundings, and have worked on this avenue by exploring AGN feedback in galaxy clusters as a senior undergrad and during the first year of my PhD. As a PhD student at MIT, I worked on a particularly interesting system at relatively high redshift (z $\sim$ 1.4, which is high redshift for galaxy cluster folks!). This system looked surprisingly like many of the low-redshift galaxy clusters that have been studied for the last few decades -- namely, it showed a strong cool core in the X-rays with a strong radio source associated with the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) that had enough power to offset the X-ray cooling luminosity and prevent the gas from cooling. Essentially, this high-redshift cluster showed well-regulated AGN feedback, where the central supermassive black hole in the BCG is able to prevent gas in the galaxy cluster from cooling! This is the most distant cluster we know of that has these properties, and thus, it helps set limits on when AGN feedback became a well-regulated and normal process in the universe!

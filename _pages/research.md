Reconstructing Log-normal Density Fields using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Techniques
====

My senior thesis, advised by Gary Bernstein, was on reconstructing the log-normal density field using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) techniques. Given a galaxy field (format being an NxN array with the number of galaxies in each cell), I was able to successfully reconstruct the log-normal density field.

However, there is more information that we were able to extract from the galaxy field than just the density field. Stay tuned to see what that is... (paper in prep).

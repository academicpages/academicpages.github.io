My research interests lie broadly in gravity and field theory, with a strong emphasis on formal theory. 
Particular topics I have worked on include the effective field theory (EFT) of gravity, extremal black holes and black branes, electric-magnetic duality in gravity, and $T\overline{T}$-deformed theories.  

What follows is a summary of my work, in roughly chronological order.

### Infrared Causality

As a field theory, GR is a non-renormalisable theory &mdash; this is source of the tension between QFT and GR. 
It indicates that one should make sense of this within the EFT framework, with the Einstein-Hilbert action being the leading contribution to the full effective action.
It is then natural to consider higher(-derivative) corrections to it &mdash; these capture the effects of generic UV completions of gravity without appealing to a particular quantum theory of gravity. 
From a phenomenological perspective this is a powerful tool to parameterise “quantum gravity” effects at low energies. 
A natural question is what constraints can be put on the space of possible EFTs.

(Relativistic) causality as a fundamental concept has a long history of putting constraints on the S-matrix. 
For non-gravitational theories, Wilson coefficients are constrained by positivity bounds, derived from imposing criteria such as unitarity, locality, and causality in the UV. 
Crucially, it has been noted that these are linked to causality (in the sense of subluminal propagation speeds) within the low-energy theory itself. 
Extending this to theories with dynamical gravity is subtle, because naïve causality is not invariant under field redefinitions involving the metric. 
Asymptotic causality, defined on asymptotically flat spacetimes with a causal Killing vector, demands the total scattering time delay be positive and does not suffer from this ambiguity. 

In work with my collaborators Claudia de Rham, Aoibheann Margalit, and Andrew J. Tolley, I propose infrared (IR) causality as the more refined notion of causality to constrain EFTs.
It takes the GR background geometry as the reference for causality and aligns with expectations from known partial UV completions such as QED on curved spacetime and positivity/S-matrix bootstrap bounds. 
Emphasis is put on the fact that it is crucial to be within the regime of validity of both the approximations used to compute the time delay and the EFT itself.

As an example, we applied this to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) operator as the prototypical EFT correction to gravity in $D \geq 5$. 
We showed that for graviton scattering in spherical symmetry the GB-term is consistent with IR causality as long as its Wilson coefficient is order unity. 
Within the semiclassical approximation, it looks like stronger bounds on the Wilson coefficients can be inferred by scattering off a larger number of sources.
We consider this possibility by studying scattering on pp-wave backgrounds (which includes successive shockwaves). 
We clarify that within the eikonal, semiclassical, and Born approximations the aforementioned tighter bounds are not possible within the regimes of validity of the respective approximations and the EFT itself.
  
### Deformations of Extremal Black Holes

Black holes are ubiquitous objects in our universe, that (in four dimensions) can be characterised by their mass, charge, and angular momentum. 
Physical black holes satisfy certain inequalities that put upper limits on their charge and angular momentum, and black holes saturating these are known as extremal black holes.
Recently, it has been argued that certain static deformations lead to singularities at their horizons. 

Intriguingly, this effect is absent for particular modes in GR, so that the existence of these diverging tidal forces depends strongly on the Wilson coefficients of the EFT. 
This is however in stark contrast with usual intuition we have about EFTs, namely the principles of decoupling and separation of scales. 
In my work in collaboration with Andrew J. Tolley and Claudia de Rham, I take a closer look at these deformations to resolve this underlying tension. 
We clarify that the apparent UV sensitivity is not due to a breakdown of EFT, but rather indicates metric perturbation theory breaking down.
This is demonstrated by an example of a partial UV completion.
We also discuss a speculative bound on EFT Wilson coefficients linked to the weak gravity conjecture.

### Electromagnetic Duality and Higher-Spin Gravity

Maxwell theory in vacuum has a curious symmetry known as electromagnetic duality.
Exchanging the electric and magnetic field exchanges the equation of motion and the Bianchi identity &mdash; this is therefore an on-shell symmetry.
Na&iuml;vely, it appears that the action is not invariant under this, but it was shown that electromagnetic duality is indeed an off-shell symmetry (*e.g.* associated with a conserved charge).
The same in fact applies to a whole range of other theories, linearised (partially) massless gravity, higher-spin gauge fields, and p-form electrodynamics. 
In all these cases, the (classical) equations of motion can be cast into a twisted self-duality-type relation.
Closely related to these are chiral forms, which satisfy (anti-)self-duality relations. 

Early attempts at constructing actions with twisted self-duality relations as equations of motion (in other words, manifest duality) have typically come at the expense of covariance.
Only relatively recently has it been understood that a natural covariant description of such theories comes from topological field theory in one higher dimension.
In my work with Karapet Mkrtchyan, Euihun Joung, and Junggi Yoon, I use this to find covariant higher-spin generalisations to the Floreanini-Jackiw and Alekseev-Shatashvili actions, describing higher-order chiral scalars in 2D.
These are boundary degrees of freedom of 3D higher-spin gravity after appropriate reduction. 
Eventually, the goal is to achieve the same for gravity and higher-spins in $D=4$ and higher. 

### Extremal Black Branes

Black branes are extended versions of black holes in higher dimensions with non-compact horizons.
These feature prominently as classical solutions within supergravity, and *e.g.* play a role in the microstate counting of black hole entropy in string theory.
Just like black holes can be charged under a 1-form gauge field, black branes can be charged under higher-form fields.
The charge and mass of these black branes are also subject to BPS bounds, which are saturated by extremal black branes.
Sub-extremal black branes are subject to the so-called Gregory-Laflamme instability, triggered by perturbations with sufficiently small wavelength. 
This instability switches off in the extremal limit, which suggests that extremal black branes should be stable. 

In work with A. D. Kovacs, I argue that extremal black branes suffer from the so-called Aretakis instability, making explicit use of the symmetries of the near-horizon geometry $AdS_{p+2} \times S^{D-p-2}$. 
This is a classical instability which was already known to afflict extremal black holes. In particular, the strength of the Aretakis instability, *i.e.* the number of transverse derivatives needed to see non-decay/blow-up of the fields, is related to their scaling dimensions of fields within the $AdS_{p+2}$-factor. 
To demonstrate that this class of extremal black branes suffers from this instability even in the absence of additional fields, we compute the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of gravitational and form field perturbations of the near-horizon geometry of these black branes &mdash; we find that these indeed trigger the Aretakis instability, although this is weaker than for the extremal black branes.

For black holes, it was shown that the Aretakis instability generically pushes extremal black holes to become sub-extremal. It would be interesting if this is the case also for extremal black branes, as these would then be subject to the Gregory-Laflamme instability &mdash; in this case, one would expect that the end-point of this evolution is an array of sub-extremal black holes.

Finally, it is worth noting that the scaling dimensions also determine the behaviour of static deformations to the near-horizon geometry of extremal black branes. Parallel to the previous discussion on deformations of extremal black holes, the Aretakis instability will therefore allow for set-ups which are seemingly UV sensitive.

Research on the mechanism of the rural roads on the revitalization of rural industries in Gansu Province	        |Sep.2020 - Aug.2021
======
Lanzhou Jiaotong University | Research Assistant
* Objective: To investigate the impact of rural roads on the industry in rural areas, taking rural roads as the main research object, revealing the mechanism of the role of the rural roads in the revitalization of the industry
* The evaluation index system was established to analyze the relationship between the rural roads and agricultural industries
* Utilized the entropy value method and Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP) method to comprehensively assign weights to the index system, and calculated coupling coordination. 
* It is concluded that rural roads and agricultural industries in the study area are in a high degree of coupling, and county roads are developed in a point-axis pattern.
* Delivery: Completed a research report, and a research paper titled Research on Coordination Relationship between Development of Rural Roads and Industrial Structure of Agriculture

  <h3> Main Projects </h3>
  <br>
  1. Computational neurethological basis of primate grooming: this project combines neural modeling, imitation learning, and computer vision to develop a computational framework describing how primates use social touch to communicate.
  <br>
  <br>
  2. Neural correlates of natural social primate behavior: this project combines wireless neurophysiology and computer vision to understand the neural processes across the macaque (social) behavioral repertoire.

<p>Here is a network representing my work and collaborators; the color of each node specifies what it represents: <span style="color:#1722C1">co-authors</span>, <span style="color:#90d185">preprints</span>, <span style="color:#138400">publications</span> and <span style="color:#8e20c1">theses</span> (in this case co-authors are supervisors and co-supervisors).<br>
Hover and click on each node for more information, or drag them around to change the network's shape.</p>

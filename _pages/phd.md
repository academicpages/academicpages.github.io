## Subject Title

Methodology development to guarantee building photovoltaic systems' performance including failure modelling.

## Subject Content

The objective of the thesis is to define and validate a methodology to guarantee the real performance of photovoltaic systems on buildings that can be widely deployed. This method could be envisioned to inspect new installations upon receipt, but also existing installations, to suggest a rehabilitation plan that would be the most effective. 

This work would lead to:
1. Assess diagnostic methods and their limits.
2. Identify and model the main failures.
3. Model the whole solar installation system with failure and diagnostic operations.
4. Establish the performance guarantee methodology. 


## Collaboration
The PhD is in collaboration within 3 entities:
* Heliocity: Industrial expert in performance assesment of building photovoltaic installations via data-driven methods
* CSTB (Scientific and Technical Center for Building): Scientific industrial expert on building energy performance with known experimental know-how
* LOCIE (Laboratory for Design Optimization and Environmental Engineering):  Joint research unit of the Université Savoie Mont Blanc and CNRS working in engineering sciences and systems

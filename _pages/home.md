### About Me ###
Since September 2021, I am a Postdoc at Aarhus University ([Crypto Group](https://users-cs.au.dk/orlandi/cryptogroup/)), hosted by [Claudio Orlandi](https://cs.au.dk/~orlandi/).
From August 2017 to September 2021, I was a Ph.D. student at Stevens Institute of Technology under the supervision of [Giuseppe Ateniese](https://ateniese.github.io).
I got my Bachelor's and Master's degree in Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome.

### Research Interests ###
My research interests are theoretical and applied cryptography with a focus on advanced public-key primitives and their applications.
I am also interested in blockchain and privacy-preserving machine learning.

### Grants ###

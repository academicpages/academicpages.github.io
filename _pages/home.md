<h1> Hi, I'm Avra. </h1>
Another curious being, who is interested in science, politics and happenings in the world. You can expect me to update here with my on-going [research](https://avratanubiswas.github.io/research/) works and also blog posts, in different topics from sevral open-source enthusiasts who are interested to share their writings in this small but growing space called [cats-and-codes](https://avratanubiswas.github.io/cats-and-codes/). Happy to connect with you!

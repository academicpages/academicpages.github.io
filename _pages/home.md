Welcome to my website!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/) at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/). I expect to graduate in 2023. My research interests are in the areas of Development Economics, Information Economics, and Applied Microeconomics.

I am in the 2022-23 job market. I will be available for interviews during EJM and ASSA.

<!-- My work informs policy considerations and speaks to the micro-development concerns in the technology adoption literature. -->

My doctoral research focuses on analyzing the role played by information frictions in driving technology adoption decisions. I investigate development policies for resolving these frictions and aiding economic agents in developing countries to learn about new technologies and products. In my [job market paper](/files/pdf/Network-Based Targeting with Heterogeneous Agents for Improving Technology Adoption.pdf), I explore network-based targeting for improving the adoption of technologies having heterogeneous benefits in a population. To do so, I theoretically model information diffusion in a network with heterogeneous agents, use simulations to generate testable predictions from the model, and validate them using experimental data from Malawi. My other related chapters address the role of experience in learning about index insurance products for farmers in Kenya and explore the effect of active discussion in learning about uncertain technologies for Peruvian potato farmers.

Apple I
We are apples
Not called with other names
Never heard we are disparate
We are apples from TREES

Our
Radiant reddish red
Greenery greenish green
Pied, mottled, spotted skin;
Our inside is always yellowish white with dark seeds—
Together called “APPLE” ‘gain and ‘gain

Big or small, or whole or pieced
Cracked or crushed or crumbled
Just before swallowed
Englutted through the gorge
Our juicy juice and sweet smell & flavor
Ours, ALWAYS!

We are apples
Never called differently
We are apples
We are apples in ONE WOODEN BOX.

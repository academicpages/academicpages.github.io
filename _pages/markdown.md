## Locations of key files/directories

* Basic config options: _config.yml
* Top navigation bar config: _data/navigation.yml
* Single pages: _pages/
* Collections of pages are .md or .html files in:
  * _publications/
  * _portfolio/
  * _posts/
  * _teaching/
  * _talks/
* Footer: _includes/footer.html
* Static files (like PDFs): /files/
* Profile image (can set in _config.yml): images/profile.png

## Tips and hints

* Name a file ".md" to have it render in markdown, name it ".html" to render in HTML.
* Go to the [commit list](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/commits/master) (on your repo) to find the last version GitHub built with Jekyll. 
  * Green check: successful build
  * Orange circle: building
  * Red X: error
  * No icon: not built

* Academic Pages uses [Jekyll Kramdown](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/), GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) parser, which is similar to the version of Markdown used on GitHub, but may have some minor differences. 
  * Some of emoji supported on GitHub should be supposed via the [Jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji) plugin :computer:.
  * The best list of the supported emoji can be found in the [Emojis for Jekyll via Jemoji](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2021-08-16-emojis_for_Jekyll/#computer) blog post.

* While GitHub Pages prevents server side code from running, client-side scripts are supported.
  * This means that Google Analytics is supported, and [the wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki/Adding-Google-Analytics) should contain the most up-to-date information on getting it working.

* Your CV can be written using either Markdown ([preview](https://academicpages.github.io/cv/)) or generated via JSON ([preview](https://academicpages.github.io/cv-json/)) and the layouts are slightly different. You can update the path to the one being used in `_data/navigation.yml` with the JSON formatted CV being hidden by default.

 * The [Liquid syntax guide](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/control-flow/) is a useful guide for those that want to add functionality to the template or to become contributors to the [template on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).

## MathJax 

Support for MathJax (version 3.* via [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), [documentation](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/)) is included in the template:

$$
\displaylines{
\nabla \cdot E= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\\
\nabla \cdot B=0 \\\
\nabla \times E= -\partial_tB \\\
\nabla \times B  = \mu_0 \left(J + \varepsilon_0 \partial_t E \right)
}
$$

The default delimiters of `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` are supported for displayed mathematics, while `\\(...\\)` should be used for in-line mathematics (ex., \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\))

**Note** that since Academic Pages uses Markdown which cases some interference with MathJax and LaTeX for escaping characters and new lines, although [some workarounds exist](https://math.codidact.com/posts/278763/278772#answer-278772). In some cases, such as when you are including MathJax in a `citation` field for publications, it may be necessary to use `\(...\)` for inline delineation.

## Mermaid diagrams
Academic Pages includes support for [Mermaid diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/) (version 11.* via [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)) and in addition to their [tutorials](https://mermaid.js.org/ecosystem/tutorials.html) and [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) the basic syntax is as follows:

```markdown
    ```mermaid
    graph LR
    A-->B
    ```
```

Which produces the following plot with the [default theme](https://mermaid.js.org/config/theming.html) applied:

```mermaid
graph LR
A-->B
```

While a more advanced plot with the `forest` theme applied looks like the following:

```mermaid
---
config:
  theme: 'forest'
---
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

## Plotly
Academic Pages includes support for Plotly diagrams via a hook in the Markdown code elements, although those that are comfortable with HTML and JavaScript can also access it [via those routes](https://plotly.com/javascript/getting-started/).

In order to render a Plotly plot via Markdown the relevant plot data need to be added as follows:

```markdown
    ```plotly
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "x": [1, 2, 3, 4],
          "y": [10, 15, 13, 17],
          "type": "scatter"
        },
        {
          "x": [1, 2, 3, 4],
          "y": [16, 5, 11, 9],
          "type": "scatter"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
```

**Important!** Since the data is parsed as JSON *all* of the keys will need to be quoted for the plot to render. The use of a tool like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) to check syntax is highly recommended.
{: .notice}

Which produces the following:
```plotly
{
  "data": [
    {
      "x": [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "y": [10, 15, 13, 17],
      "type": "scatter"
    },
    {
      "x": [1, 2, 3, 4],
      "y": [16, 5, 11, 9],
      "type": "scatter"
    }
  ]
}
```

Essentially what is taking place is that the [Plotly attributes](https://plotly.com/javascript/reference/index/) are being taken from the code block as JSON data, parsed, and passed to Plotly along with a theme that matches the current site theme (i.e., a light theme, or a dark theme). This allows all plots that can be described via the `data` attribute to rendered with some limitations for the theme of the plot.

```plotly
{
  "data": [
    {
      "x": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
      "y": [1, 6, 3, 6, 1],
      "mode": "markers",

    },
    {
      "x": [1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5],
      "y": [4, 1, 7, 1, 4],
      "mode": "markers",
      "type": "scatter",
      "name": "Team B",
      "text": ["B-a", "B-b", "B-c", "B-d", "B-e"],
      "marker": { "size": 12 }
    }    
  ],
  "layout": {
    "xaxis": {
      "range": [ 0.75, 5.25 ]
    },
    "yaxis": {
      "range": [0, 8]
    },
    "title": {"text": "Data Labels Hover"}
  }
}
```

```plotly
{
  "data": [{
      "x": [1, 2, 3],
      "y": [4, 5, 6],
      "type": "scatter"
    },
    {
      "x": [20, 30, 40],
      "y": [50, 60, 70],
      "xaxis": "x2",
      "yaxis": "y2",
      "type": "scatter"
  }],
  "layout": {
    "grid": {
      "rows": 1,
      "columns": 2,
      "pattern": "independent"
    },
    "title": {
      "text": "Simple Subplot"
    }    
  }
}
```

```plotly
{
  "data": [{
		"z": [[10, 10.625, 12.5, 15.625, 20],
          [5.625, 6.25, 8.125, 11.25, 15.625],
          [2.5, 3.125, 5.0, 8.125, 12.5],
          [0.625, 1.25, 3.125, 6.25, 10.625],
          [0, 0.625, 2.5, 5.625, 10]],
		"type": "contour"
	}],
  "layout": {
    "title": {
      "text": "Basic Contour Plot"
    }
  }
}
```

## Markdown guide

Academic Pages uses [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/index.html) for Markdown rendering, which has some differences from other Markdown implementations such as GitHub's. In addition to this guide, please see the [kramdown Syntax page](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) for full documentation.

## Buttons

Make any link standout more when applying the `.btn` class.

## Notices

Basic notices or call-outs are supported using the following syntax:

```markdown
**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to the line following paragraph.
{: .notice}
```

which wil render as:

**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to the line following paragraph.
{: .notice}

### Footnotes

Footnotes can be useful for clarifying points in the text, or citing information.[^1] Markdown support numeric footnotes, as well as text as long as the values are unique.[^note]

```markdown
This is the regular text.[^1] This is more regular text.[^note]

[^1]: This is the footnote itself.
[^note]: This is another footnote.
```

[^1]: Such as this footnote.
[^note]: When using text for footnotes markers, no spaces are permitted in the name.

## HTML Tags

### Address Tag

<address>
  1 Infinite Loop<br /> Cupertino, CA 95014<br /> United States
</address>

### Anchor Tag (aka. Link)

This is an example of a [link](http://github.com "GitHub").

### Abbreviation Tag

The abbreviation CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".

*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets

### Cite Tag

"Code is poetry." ---<cite>Automattic</cite>

### Code Tag

You will learn later on in these tests that `word-wrap: break-word;` will be your best friend.

You can also write larger blocks of code with syntax highlighting supported for some languages, such as Python:

```python
print('Hello World!')
```

or R:

```R
print("Hello World!", quote = FALSE)
```

### Details Tag (collapsible sections)

The HTML `<details>` tag works well with Markdown and allows you to include collapsible sections, see [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_details.asp) for more information on how to use the tag.

<details>
  <summary>Collapsed by default</summary>
  This section was collapsed by default!
</details>

The source code:

```HTML
<details>
  <summary>Collapsed by default</summary>
  This section was collapsed by default!
</details>
```

Or, you can leave a section open by default by including the `open` attribute in the tag:

<details open>
  <summary>Open by default</summary>
  This section is open by default thanks to open in the &lt;details open&gt; tag!
</details>


### Emphasize Tag

The emphasize tag should _italicize_ text.

### Insert Tag

This tag should denote <ins>inserted</ins> text.

### Keyboard Tag

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the `<code>` tag.

### Preformatted Tag

This tag styles large blocks of code.

<pre>
.post-title {
  margin: 0 0 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 38px;
  line-height: 1.2;
  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

### Quote Tag

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

### Strike Tag

This tag will let you <strike>strikeout text</strike>.

### Strong Tag

This tag shows **bold text**.

### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

### Superscript Tag

Still sticking with science and Isaac Newton's E = MC<sup>2</sup>, which should lift the 2 up.

### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>.

***
**Footnotes**

The footnotes in the page will be returned following this line, return to the section on <a href="#footnotes">Markdown Footnotes</a>.

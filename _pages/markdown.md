## Locations of key files/directories

* Basic config options: _config.yml
* Top navigation bar config: _data/navigation.yml
* Single pages: _pages/
* Collections of pages are .md or .html files in:
  * _publications/
  * _posts/
  * _teaching/
  * _talks/
* Footer: _includes/footer.html
* Static files (like PDFs): /files/
* Profile image (can set in _config.yml): images/profile.png

## Tips and hints

* Name a file ".md" to have it render in markdown, name it ".html" to render in HTML.
* Go to the [commit list](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/commits/master) (on your repo) to find the last version Github built with Jekyll. 
  * Green check: successful build
  * Orange circle: building
  * Red X: error
  * No icon: not built
* Academic Pages uses [Jekyll Kramdown](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/), GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) parser, which is similar to the version of Markdown used on GitHub, but may have some minor differences. 
  * Some of emoji supported on GitHub should be supposed via the [Jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji) plugin :computer:.
  * The best list of the supported emoji can be found in the [Emojis for Jekyll via Jemoji](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2021-08-16-emojis_for_Jekyll/#computer) blog post.

 * [MathJax Documentation](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/)

## MathJax 

Support for MathJax Version 3.0 is included in the template:

$$
\displaylines{
\nabla \cdot E= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\\
\nabla \cdot B=0 \\\
\nabla \times E= -\partial_tB \\\
\nabla \times B  = \mu_0 \left(J + \varepsilon_0 \partial_t E \right)
}
$$

The default delimiters of `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` are supported for displayed mathematics, while `\\(...\\)` should be used for in-line mathematics (ex., \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\))

**Note** that since Academic Pages uses Markdown which cases some interference with MathJax and LaTeX for escaping characters and new lines, although [some workarounds exist](https://math.codidact.com/posts/278763/278772#answer-278772).

## Markdown guide

Academic Pages uses [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/index.html) for Markdown rendering, which has some differences from other Markdown implementations such as GitHub's. In addition to this guide, please see the [kramdown Syntax page](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html) for full documentation.

```

or R:

```R
print("Hello World!", quote = FALSE)
```

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the `<code>` tag.

### Preformatted Tag

<pre>
.post-title {
  margin: 0 0 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 38px;
  line-height: 1.2;
  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

### Quote Tag

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

### Strong Tag

This tag shows **bold text**.

### Subscript Tag

### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>.

## Some of my favourite maths blogs

* [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HomePage)
 a wiki-lab for collaborative work on Mathematics, Physics and Philosophy heavily oriented toward discussions on category theory
and higher category theory. I started using nLab since 2014 and since then it has literally become a place where I spent a good deal of time learning about category theory and higher category theory. I also have seen how beautifully the collaborative effort of many people has resulted in such a great database. Remarkably there has been a great expansion of pages since first time I was there. If your work involves (higher) category theory then chances are you already know nLab place and use it frequently. However, If you are new to category theory then use nLab, but take this advice with a grain of salt. I remember my first experience of learning category theory back in 2014 using nLab among other sources and it was first a bit confusing. There are sometimes incomplete sources and sometimes self-referential , or even worse non-terminating cross-linking of pages. _Not to mention that in order to learn category theory first you have to learn infinity categories._    

* [The n-Category Café](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/)
 Called n-Cafe for short, it is a A group blog where authors posts intriguing stuff on recent research work mostly on cateogry theory, higher category theory, categorical logic, diagramatic reasoning, applied category theory. The posts are not too long and they tend to bring the core ideas to the front for general maths audience. 
 
* [HoTT Blog](https://homotopytypetheory.org/blog/)
 The main blog for homotopy type theory (aka univalent foundation aka synthetic homotopy theory)

* [Physics Forum](https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/a-first-idea-of-quantum-field-theory/)
 Ocassionally, I read the posts on mathematical physics on physics forum, particularly from Urs Schrieber and John Baez.  
 
 * [Terence Tao's Blog](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/)

* [Polymath Project](http://michaelnielsen.org/polymath1/index.php?title=Main_Page)

* [John Baez's Stuff](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/)

* [Annoying Precision](https://qchu.wordpress.com/)

* [Noncommutative geometry](http://noncommutativegeometry.blogspot.co.uk/)

* [Low Dimensional Topology](https://ldtopology.wordpress.com/about/)

* [Mathoverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/search?q=topos)
The cool feature of mathoverflow is someone can ask a research question about a paper/book and the author of that paper/book answers it!
e.g. 
 * [Peter May's answer](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/204167/why-should-have-peter-may-worked-with-cgwh-instead-of-cgh-in-the-geometry-of-it) 
 * [Lurie's answer to the question on the relation between toposes and infinity toposes](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/92454/relation-between-topos-and-infty-topos)

## This Wesbite


This website is hosted on **GitHub pages**. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. Pages are created by [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/), a more user-friendly version of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and perfect for building minimal and static, yet beautiful, secure, and stable websites. A really quick and easy-to-follow guide is provided [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). For a quick start, you can also find the source code for setting up your own website at [barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).  

I used the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).


Make sure you check this [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) as well. Personally, I found it very useful and succinct. 


## Why Jekyll at all? 

You can do so much with Jekyll. Some of the best web developers use it for building their own websites. Here is a good examples:
[CSS Wizardy](https://csswizardry.com/about/).

But if you are, like me, an academic and want to publish your website with the help of Jekyll as fast as possible and not necessarily concerned about how fancy your website should look like, you may be interested in reading
[Github for academics](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/06/04/github-for-academics/).

Also, a really cool maths blog on discrete geometry, graph theory, and other stuff built by Jekyll: [11011110](https://11011110.github.io/blog/)

### How to write maths with Jekyll? 

**MathJax** is an open source JavaScript display engine for mathematics that works in all browsers.

[Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) comes with optional support for LaTeX to PNG rendering via MathJax within math blocks. This [blogpost](http://gastonsanchez.com/visually-enforced/opinion/2014/02/16/Mathjax-with-jekyll/) has a good tutorial on how to use MathJax with Jekyll. Also, you will probably find the official [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html) website useful.


### Tips and hints for using Markdown

* Name a file ".md" to have it render in markdown, name it ".html" to render in HTML.
* Go to the [commit list](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/commits/master) (on your repo) to find the last version Github built with Jekyll. 
  * Green check: successful build
  * Orange circle: building
  * Red X: error
  * No icon: not built

This tag will let you <strike>strikeout text</strike>.

#### Emphasize Tag

The emphasize tag should _italicize_ text.

#### Insert Tag

This tag should denote <ins>inserted</ins> text.

#### Keyboard Tag

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the `<code>` tag.

#### Preformatted Tag

This tag styles large blocks of code.

<pre>
.post-title {
  margin: 0 0 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 38px;
  line-height: 1.2;
  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

#### Quote Tag

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

#### Strong Tag

This tag shows **bold text**.

#### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

#### Superscript Tag

Still sticking with science and Isaac Newton's E = MC<sup>2</sup>, which should lift the 2 up.

#### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>.

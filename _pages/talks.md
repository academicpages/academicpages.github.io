Below you can find some information on talks I have given in the past, in roughly anti-chronological order.

### Extremal Black Branes

Based on [2507.12529](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12529) in collaboration with A. D. Kovacs.

>**Abstract**: The Gregory-Laflamme instability is a small-wavelength instability in the s-wave sector of sub-extremal black branes. It is known that this disappears in the extremal limit. 
>
> In this talk, I will demonstrate that extremal black branes instead suffer from the so-called Aretakis instability &mdash; a classical instability already known to afflict extremal black holes. Our derivations of this uses the symmetries of the near-horizon geometry $AdS_{p+2} \times S^{D-p-2}$. In particular, the strength of the Aretakis instability, given by the number of transverse derivatives needed to see non-decay/blow-up at late null times, is determined by the scaling dimensions of fields with respect to the $AdS_{p+2}$-factor in the near-horizon geometry. To demonstrate that this is an instability of the black brane itself, we computed the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of mixed gravitational and form field perturbations in the near-horizon geometry, and confirm that the Aretakis instability is present for extremal black branes, although this is weaker than for extremal black holes.
>
> If time permits, I will discuss how the scaling dimensions determine static deformations to the near-horizon geometry of such extremal black branes, and how extremal black branes might (or might not) be subject to UV sensitivity.    

I've had the chance to give this seminar on the following occasions:

- GR24/Amaldi16, Glasgow, Jul 2025

### Covariant Actions for 2D Chiral Scalars

Based on [2501.16463](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16463) in collaboration with K. Mkrtchyan, E. Joung, and J. Yoon.

>**Abstract**: Theories enjoying electromagnetic duality and fields obeying (anti-)self-duality relations are intimately connected and ubiquitous in theoretical physics. Prominent examples are e.g. electromagnetism and gravity, and the 4-form in type-IIB supergravity. A long-standing problem has been to formulate actions describing such theories with manifest duality.
>
>In the first part of this talk, I will introduce electromagnetic duality and generalisations of it using familiar examples. I will review early action formulations with manifest duality at the expense of manifest covariance, and then present recent developments on actions with manifest duality and covariance.
>
>In the second part of this talk, I will focus on applying one such formulation to boundary degrees of freedom in AdS_3 (higher-spin) gravity. These are higher-order scalars, which also satisfy self-duality equations.

I've had the chance to give this seminar on the following occasions:

- String Theory Seminar, National Taiwan University, Apr 2025

### Extremal Black Holes and UV Sensitivity

Based on [2408.05549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05549) in collaboration with C. de Rham and A. J. Tolley. 

>**Abstract**: Recently, it was noted that extremal black holes generically suffer from singularities on their event horizons. Particular deformations of asymptotically flat extremal black holes were shown to be marginal, causing the existence of these singularities to strongly depend on even small higher-derivative effective field theory (EFT) corrections, i.e. quantum gravity effects. 
>
> In this talk, I will re-examine these singular deformations with a particular focus on the extremal limit and breakdown of perturbation theory. I will then study EFT corrections to a tower of marginally deformed extremal charged black holes in AdS and speculatively derive bounds on EFT coefficients from them. These are closely related to otherwise known bounds from causality and the swampland program, and would provide direct insight into UV completions to GR.

### Stacking and Balancing Casual Causality

Based on [2112.05031](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05031) and [2309.04534](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04534) in collaboration with C. de Rham, A. Margalit, and A. J. Tolley. 

>**Abstract**: In recent years, causality has emerged as a powerful criterion to distinguish between effective field theories (EFTs) arising from physical and unphysical high-energy theories. 
>
>A direct way to ensure a given EFT is causal is to demand a lower bound on scattering time delays. In flat space, this is unambiguously dictated by the Minkowski light cones, but the situation is more subtle with dynamical gravity. I will make the case that the relevant notion is so-called infrared (IR) causality. 
>
>As an example, I will apply this to study Gauss-Bonnet gravity in $D \geq 5$. For graviton scattering in spherical symmetry, IR causality is satisfied as long as the coupling is order unity. I will emphasise that it is not possible to find sharper bounds by scattering off multiple sources while staying within the regimes of the eikonal, semiclassical, and Born approximations and the EFT itself.

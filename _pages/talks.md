Below you can find some information on talks I have given in the past.

## Extremal Black Holes 

Based on [2408.05549](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05549) in collaboration with C. de Rham and A. J. Tolley. 

>**Abstract**: Recently, it was noted that extremal black holes generically suffer from singularities on their event horizons. Particular deformations of asymptotically flat extremal black holes were shown to be marginal, causing the existence of these singularities to strongly depend on even small higher-derivative effective field theory (EFT) corrections, i.e. quantum gravity effects. 
>
> In this talk, I will re-examine these singular deformations with a particular focus on the extremal limit and breakdown of perturbation theory. I will then study EFT corrections to a tower of marginally deformed extremal charged black holes in AdS and speculatively derive bounds on EFT coefficients from them. These are closely related to otherwise known bounds from causality and the swampland program, and would provide direct insight into UV completions to GR.

I've had the chance to give this seminar on the following occasions:

- Theory Colloquium, Imperial College London, Jul 2024
- UK Cosmomology Meeting/Ruth Fest, Kings College London, May 2024
- BritGrav24, Queen Mary University, Apr 2024

## Stacking and Balancing Casual Causality

Based on [2112.05031](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05031) and [2309.04534](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04534) in collaboration with C. de Rham, A. Margalit, and A. J. Tolley. 

>**Abstract**: In recent years, causality has emerged as a powerful criterion to distinguish between effective field theories (EFTs) arising from physical and unphysical high-energy theories. 
>
>A direct way to ensure a given EFT is causal is to demand a lower bound on scattering time delays. In flat space, this is unambiguously dictated by the Minkowski light cones, but the situation is more subtle with dynamical gravity. I will make the case that the relevant notion is so-called infrared (IR) causality. 
>
>As an example, I will apply this to study Gauss-Bonnet gravity in $D \geq 5$. For graviton scattering in spherical symmetry, IR causality is satisfied as long as the coupling is order unity. I will emphasise that it is not possible to find sharper bounds by scattering off multiple sources while staying within the regimes of the eikonal, semiclassical, and Born approximations and the EFT itself.

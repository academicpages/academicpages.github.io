I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in [Industrial and Systems Engineering University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/isye), where I am advised by Professor [Krishnamurthy Iyer](https://cse.umn.edu/isye/krishnamurthy-iyer).

My research interests include information design, algorithmic game theory, and data science. My current research focuses
on optimal information sharing in dynamic environments.

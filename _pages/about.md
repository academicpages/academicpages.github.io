Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the
[Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy](https://wc.wustl.edu/) 
and [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/) at
[Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). I am also an
affiliated researcher with the
[Data-driven Analysis of Peace Project](https://dapp-lab.org) lab. I specialize
in International Relations and Political Methodology. I earned my Ph.D in
Political Science from the
[University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) and my
B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/).

My work has been [published](publications) in
*International Studies Quarterly*, *Conflict Management and Peace Science*, and
*Political Science Research and Methods*, among other outlets.
My [research](research) explores the causes and consequences of political
violence using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models,
geospatial analysis, and big data. While I primarily focus on civil conflict, I
also examine contentious political phenomena including terrorism and economic
statecraft. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in both international
relations and quantitative methodology.

🎓 I’m an undergraduate student currently pursuing a double Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Physics at Université Paris-Saclay.

🌌  My intellectual curiosity is rooted in the deep structures of physical reality. I’m especially drawn to theoretical/mathematical physics, cosmology and anything that blurs the line between mathematics and physics. Right now, I'm exploring how the universe might be accelerating under the influence of dark energy and I'm proposing a scalar field approach to explain this acceleration — and how we can model that from first principles.

🗞️ Alongside my academic path, I’ll be writing articles and blog posts — not just about physics and maths, but also about broader ideas. Think of it as a personal "Opinions" section: I’ll be sharing thoughts on education, identity, meaning, and the strange balance between ambition and uncertainty in a world that often demands both. If it matters to how we live and think, I’ll probably write about it.

🌍 Multilingual and deeply international, I care about bridging ideas, cultures, and disciplines. I believe that science doesn’t happen in a vacuum, and neither should scientists.

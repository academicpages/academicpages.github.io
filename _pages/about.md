Hi there! I am Fazilet, a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, working with Dr Cengiz Oztireli. My research interests lie in the intersection between machine learning and image processing and also include computer graphics. During my PhD, I would like to develop techniques that can integrate artist-created models into learning-based algorithms to manipulate 3D scenes on the image level.

## News

* Our poster entitled “Patch-adaptive Transformation Blending for One-Shot Photo Retouching” has been accepted for poster presentation at [ICCP 2022](https://iccp2022.iccp-conference.org/), which is to be held in Caltech, Pasadena, August 1-3, 2022😊
* I will be an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon's computer vision research team in Berlin this summer (July, 2022)🥳
* I gave a lecture on Convolutional Neural Networks at Women@CL GWML Introduction to Machine Learning Workshop, 19 June 2022🤓 

<!-- develop efficient methods to enhance or manipulate images and expand their applications for 3D scene manipulations.

<!-- I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Graphics and Interaction Group, working with Dr. Cengiz Oztireli. Before this, I  received my M.Sc. in signal processing and communications from the University of Edinburgh in 2019 and completed my B.Sc. in electrical and electronics engineering at Bogazici University, Turkey, in 2018.

During my master's, I worked on image super-resolution problem under the supervision of Prof. Mike Davies, which led me to pursue a Ph.D. in the area of image processing with machine learning (ML) techniques. In my undergrad, I conducted research on molecular communications, in which we designed a novel molecular communications system and estimated its optimal parameters.

My current research focuses on image enhancement with ML algorithms. During my research journey, I would like to explore efficient methods to enhance images both visually and quantitatively and expand their application to 3D data. Other than this, I work part-time in an image-based weed detection project, in which our aim is to develop a system that can reliably detect black-grass in cereal crops.

I am a third-year PhD student at the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) department of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), supervised by Prof. Gregory W. Wornell. My research interests span the fields of computer vision and computational imaging, and I am currently focusing on problems in 3D vision and non-line-of-sight imaging. -->

My current research aims at integrating ML methods with well-known artist-created models to retouch photos. Professional artist retouches usually do not only adjust tone and color but also modify texture with fine details. Therefore, photographers spend a considerable amount of time on the design of their retouches. With ML techniques steered by such artist-created models, I would like to reduce the complexity of such retouching techniques.

Sometimes I try to summarize papers about the subjects I am interested in as it is a good writing practice and a helper to understand a subject better. You can find some of my summaries in [Blog Posts](https://faziletgokbudak.github.io/year-archive/).

<!-- My research aims at designing efficient learning-based methods integrated with artist-created models to manipulate 3D scenes in 2D settings. By imposing some prior knowledge on the nature of the task or the data itself, photographers and 3D artists design such edits that comprise a series of global adjustments and more detailed local changes. My work aims at automating this editing pipeline with the help of advances in machine learning methods along with well-established artist-created techniques.

<!-- I also enjoy following the developments in communications technologies.

<!-- As for my research experience, I worked part-time in an image-based weed detection project, in which we aimed at developing a system that can reliably detect blackgrass in cereal crops. We met the final milestone of the project, in which our model trained with a novel dataset achieved more than 80% accuracy in blackgrass detection. Before joining Cambridge Computer Lab, I worked on two different research projects. One is about molecular communications, where we designed a novel molecular communications system. In the end, we published the results in IEEE-TMBMC. The other project is for my master's dissertation on super-resolution (SR), in which I achieved a distinction. I implemented different SR techniques and analyzed the results from a signal processing perspective (For details of all these projects, please visit [Projects](https://faziletgokbudak.github.io/projects/)).

In addition to my research experiences, I also worked as a freelance software engineer from February until October 2020. During this period, I developed a mobile app using image hashcoding algorithms as well as creating custom widgets within Kivy framework in Python. -->


<!-- I am a female electronics engineer from Turkey, who don't really like being addressed as Mr Gokbudak! Except for Turkey, I lived in Germany for around seven months as a summer school and exchange student. Also, I studied my master's in the UK at the University of Edinburgh. You can find my educational experiences about these countries in [Blog Posts](https://faziletgokbudak.github.io/year-archive/).

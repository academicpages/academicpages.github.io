  I'm a student on the third and last year of the Master program in the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/index.htm), with joint degree in the [Aerospace Information Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.aircas.cas.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [RUI WU](http://www.aircas.cn/sourcedb_air_cas/cn/expert/yjy/202306/t20230613_6777600.html)  from Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2021, I received the Bachelor degree in electronic information engineering from the [China Agricultural University](https://www.cau.edu.cn/), China.

  I'm majoring in RF integrated circuit designs and have gained rich experience in the area through out the years. My research interests include RF/mm-wave integrated circuit designs, front-ends in phased-array systems and I'm always eager for new knowledge and to expand a wider range of capability.

  Currently I'm seeking for a PhD postion on RF integrated circuit design or other related fields.

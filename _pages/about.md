Welcome! I’m **Yusang (Stella) He**, a researcher working at the intersection of **text-based financial economics, corporate governance, empirical asset pricing, and machine learning**. I build scalable data pipelines, extract structured insights from large unstructured datasets, and use both econometric and computational tools to study real-world financial behavior.

I recently completed my **M.S. in Applied Mathematics** at **Columbia University**, following a **B.S. in Mathematics & Economics** at the **University of Texas at Austin**. My work spans financial text analysis, option pricing, corporate disclosures, and applied machine learning in high-dimensional or noisy environments.

## 🔍 Research Overview

My interests center on how **information flows**—especially textual information—shape corporate decisions and market reactions. Specific themes include:

- **Text-Based Financial Economics**  
  CEO communication, sentiment analysis, event extraction, and market narratives.

- **Corporate Governance & Disclosure**  
  Governance structures, reporting quality, and value-relevant firm behaviors.

- **Empirical Asset Pricing**  
  Linking fundamentals, text signals, and price formation.

- **Machine Learning & NLP in Finance**  
  Large-scale text processing, dictionary- or model-based sentiment, representation learning.

- **FinTech–Bank Partnerships & Intermediation**  
  Platform-based credit, digital financial infrastructure, and evolving market design.

I am drawn to research that combines **economic reasoning**, **data engineering**, and **statistical modeling** to uncover new empirical patterns with market relevance.

## 📊 Selected Projects

### **CEO Interview Sentiment & Event Analysis (INSEAD, Singapore)**  
Developed an end-to-end pipeline for **3,957 CNBC interview transcripts** (26M+ words).  
Extracted CEO-only speaking segments, applied the LM dictionary, and designed event detectors. Identified systematic sentiment differences across programs.

### **American Option Pricing via LSMC**  
Implemented a refined Longstaff–Schwartz Monte Carlo model with Laguerre basis functions.  
Performed sensitivity analyses on volatility, discounting, and dividends to study early-exercise incentives.

### **Algorithmic Trading: Fair Value Gap Strategy**  
Designed a multi-timeframe strategy for Nasdaq-100 futures.  
Achieved **6% ROI in two weeks** in controlled backtesting with strict risk management.

### **Mortgage Default Risk Modeling**  
Processed **5M+ Fannie Mae loans** and benchmarked multiple ML models for RMBS default prediction.  
Delivered >92% accuracy with strong specificity.

## 🐱 My Feline Research Assistant

Research is more enjoyable with the right collaborator.  
Meet **Momo**, my unofficial *Feline Research Assistant*, specializing in:

- Real-time computational purring (RPC)  
- Stochastic kneading processes (SKP)  
- High-frequency attention-seeking  
- Night-shift debugging supervision  
- Emotional stabilization during long Python runs

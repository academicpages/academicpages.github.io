Hi! I am now a final-year Ph.D. student at the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://english.ia.cas.cn/), Beijing, China. My major research interests are Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. Prior to CASIA, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://en.whu.edu.cn/) in 2016.  
<br/>
  

Research Interests
======
My research targets at developing machine learning methods to analyze Web contents, especially in low-resource (e.g., cross-domain transfer, learning with noisy labels, and sequence generation with few paired data), multi-task, multi-modal and adversarial attack scenarios. Currently, I focus on the following areas:
* **Opinion mining and opinionated/argumentative text generation**  
Stance analysis and computational argumentation synthesis
* **Rumor verification and fact checking**  
Determine the correctness of textual claims and structured triples in knowledge graphs      
<br/>

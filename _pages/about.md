My name is Naijing Liu. I completed her PhD in linguistics at the Australian National University in 2023. My research interests are phonology, prosody, and anthropological linguistics. I work on endangered language documentation in remote areas of Nepal and have been working as a research assistant on various anthropological and linguistic research projects in Botswana, Ethiopia, and Australia.

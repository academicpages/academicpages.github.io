**Researcher** (Earth Sciences lab) at **Prayoga Insititute of Education Research**, Bengaluru

I am researching the complex processes of near-surface environments in which interactions involving rocks, soil, water, air, and living organisms regulate the natural habitat and determine the availability of life-sustaining resources. My deep interest lies in integrating geoscience, mineralogy, geochronology, biogeochemistry, and geomicrobiology to study the impact of climate change on water and food for a sustainable future. As a geoscientist, the scientific tools that fascinate me most include geo-thermochronometric dating, luminescence dating, geomorphometric analysis, reactive transport modeling, and Bayesian deep learning. These tools can provide data about erosion and weathering patterns, regolith formation, and biogeochemical cycling from soil, water, sediment and rock samples. Integrating these data can help in understanding how natural processes and humans shape Earth's surface in making our Earth habitable, and this, in turn, can enable better management of Earth's resources effectively and efficiently.

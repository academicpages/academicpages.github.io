Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/) and [Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy](https://wc.wustl.edu/) at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). I specialize in International Relations and Political Methodology. I earned my Ph.D in Political Science from the [University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/) in 2019. I also earned my M.A. in Political Science from the University *of* North Carolina *at* Chapel Hill in 2016 and my B.A. in Political Science from [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/) in 2012.

My work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in *International Studies Quarterly*, *Political Science Research and Methods*, and *The Journal of Open Source Software*. My [research](research) explores the causes and consequences of political violence using a broad variety of methods such as latent variable models, geospatial analysis, and big data. While I primarily focus on civil conflict, I also examine contentious political phenomena including terrorism and economic statecraft. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in both international relations and quantitative methodology.

Hello! I am a Lecturer and Research Data Services Specialist at the [RDS Department at Georgia State University](https://research.library.gsu.edu/dataservices). I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Political Science at Georgia State University](https://politicalscience.gsu.edu/) in Atlanta, Georgia. I received my BA and MA from [Political Science and International Relations Department at Bogazici University](https://pols.boun.edu.tr/). My current research agenda focuses on political parties and elections, opposition cooperation and coordination, democratic backsliding, and authoritarian regimes. 

My research has been published in the *Party Politics*, *QMMR*, *Journal of Peace Research*, and *Journal of Civil Society*. My published and working papers can be found on my [publications page](https://ozlemtuncel.github.io/publications/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q4RzaGMAAAAJ&hl=en). Access my most current CV [here](https://ozlemtuncel.github.io/cv/).

I am currently working on my book project which addresses the pre-electoral coalitions formed in electoral autocratic regimes. My research on Turkey received the **Best Paper Award** at [ISA-South](https://twitter.com/ozlem__tuncel/status/1710733972873900453), **Best Fieldwork Award – Honorable Mention** from [APSA’s Democracy and Autocracy section](/files/Tuncel_APSA_Award.pdf), and got the **2nd place** at [3MT](https://twitter.com/ozlem__tuncel/status/1775221899070668826) (The Three Minute Thesis) Competition at GSU. My book project has been supported by the [William A. Steiger Fund for Legislative Studies](https://connect.apsanet.org/centennialcenter/2022/09/01/pre-electoral-opposition-coalitions-in-authoritarian-regimes/) of the APSA Centennial Grant, Craigie Fellowship, and GSU's [Library Dissertation Award](https://graduate.gsu.edu/dissertation-library-travel-awards/). See details of my project [here](https://ozlemtuncel.github.io/dissertation/).

I was part of the [Emerging Methodologists Workshop](https://sigla.georgetown.domains/emworkshop/participants/) 2024 cohort. In my free time, I volunteer at [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) or I like to hike, cook, read, and play tennis or tabletop games.

I can be contacted at otuncelgurlek1 [at] gsu [dot] edu.

About me
---
I'm a postdoctoral research associate in [Kerschensteiner Lab](https://kerschensteinerlab.wustl.edu/). My research aims to answer WHY questions about the neuronal computation and architecture in the brain. I apply a variety of machine learning tools to explore and explain the findings in mouse and human retina in responding to natural movies as well as the corresponding visual-guided behavior. 

I was a McDonnell International Scholar in the Neuroscience PhD Program at Washington University in St. Louis. In Kerschensteiner Lab, I used two-photon calcium imaging, multi-electrode array and computational modeling to study visual processing in the mouse and human retina. 

Before that, I was a visiting scholar in [Parvizi Lab](http://med.stanford.edu/parvizi-lab.html) at Stanford University. Earlier, I was a research assistant at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, National Central University in Taiwan. Earlier, I received my B.S.E. degree in Chemical Engineering from National Taiwan University. 

I am married to [Avah Banerjee](https://www.avahbanerjee.com/).

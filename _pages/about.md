I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Yale University. I specialize in international political economy with a particular focus on foreign aid, climate, and ethnic politics.  I also work on the politics of technology and international status. 

Prior to starting the PhD, I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Kosovo. I have a Master's in English literature and a very cute cat.

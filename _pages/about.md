I am MD/PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania interested in the intersection of gene regulation and human health. My thesis research with [Eric Joyce](https://ericjoycelab.com/) focused on developing [HiDRO (High-throughput DNA or RNA labeling with optimized Oligopaints)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.08.487672) to discover novel genome folding factors. I plan on pursuing residency in Pediatrics and Medical Genetics with the long-term goal of using imaging and genomics tools to advance the diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases. 

The best way to reach me is daniel dot park at pennmedicine dot upenn dot edu (I know, it's a mouthful).

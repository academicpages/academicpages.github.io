I am a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Public Administration – candidate at the University of Georgia. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Universidad Icesi (Colombia), and in 2016, I completed my master’s degree in Public Policy at Universidad de los Andes (Colombia). While pursuing my master’s, I worked with a multidisciplinary research team at the School of Government (Universidad de los Andes) in developing the foundations of a Human Resource Management Policy for the Colombian Public Sector (currently, national and subnational agencies are implementing those recommendations). In recent years (before joining the doctoral program), I worked as a public servant in various positions at the local government in Colombia (in Cali and Palmira). I experienced first-hand the multiple challenges that the public sector faces and how it responds to them. In 2019, I earned the Minciencias-Fulbright grant to pursue my Ph.D. program.

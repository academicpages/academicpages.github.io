I'm a data scientist at [Biobot Analytics](www.biobot.io), a startup transforming sewers into public health observatories.
As their first full-time data scientist, I lead our analytics and visualization efforts, and ensure customer success by communicating the value of our data to our customers.
Before joining Biobot, I received my PhD from the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT.
I worked in [Eric Alm's lab](http://almlab.mit.edu), studying the relationship between the human microbiome and health and disease.

More broadly, I'm interested in applying **personalized medicine approaches for public health**.
I'm also passionate about making local impact to move our society toward a more just ideal.
That means learning about and working for increased **diversity and equity in STEM** and **technical approaches for social good**.

During my PhD, I was an active leader in my department and at MIT, advocating for graduate students through diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and as a trained conflict coach for my peers.
I'm especially proud of having co-started the [BE Application Assistance Program](http://be.mit.edu/academic-programs/prospective-graduate/beaap) and co-written the BE Department's [Community Values Statement](http://be.mit.edu/about/department-values-statement).
Through my training to become a [BE REF](http://berefs.com), I learned **conflict management** skills that have positively impacted almost every aspect of my life.

When I'm not doing those things, I'm probably outside chasing after a **frisbee**.
Through my involvement in the sport first in [Cambodia](http://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-weekend/unconventional-sport-finds-unlikely-home-cambodia) and now on [MIT's women's team](http://scripts.mit.edu/~womens-ult/), I've become passionate about sport's ability to drive [social change](https://www.facebook.com/youthultimateproject) and push [gender equity](https://thenib.com/the-sports-wage-gap-needs-to-close) forward.

Before moving to Boston, I lived for a year in **Cambodia** working for [Engineering World Health](http://www.ewh.org/) as a [Luce Scholar](http://www.hluce.org/lsprogram.aspx).
Before that, I studied biomedical engineering at Columbia University.

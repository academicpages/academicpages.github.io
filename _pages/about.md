I am currently pursuing my doctoral studies in Health Policy and Management at Peking Union Medical College School of Health Policy and Management (2024-present), integrating my multidisciplinary background in software engineering, engineering management, and public health. With eight years of professional experience in digital healthcare, I have led cross-functional teams to implement AI solutions for clinical workflow optimization and population health management. My academic trajectory includes:
• Part-time Master of Engineering Management from Tsinghua University's Department of Automation (2020-2024)

• Advanced training in public health through Tsinghua's Health Capacity Enhancement Program (2022-2023)

• B.Eng in Software Engineering from Hebei University of Technology (2011-2015)


A data-driven personal website
======
My work consistently bridges technical execution with strategic health system objectives through evidence-based, data-empowered decision making. With over a decade of programming expertise, I possess advanced proficiency in Python, R, and Java for system development and data analytics. My technical competencies span the full lifecycle of AI implementation - from data preprocessing to deploying optimized deep learning architectures in clinical environments. Specifically in medical AI development, I have demonstrated expertise in:

• Training domain-specific large language models (LLMs) with healthcare corpus optimization

• Implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for clinical decision support

• Developing context-aware prompt engineering frameworks for medical Q&A systems

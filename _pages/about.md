I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Agricultural Economics and Policy Group at ETH Zurich since 2022. My research and teaching focus on how farms can build and maintain resilience while remaining economically viable and environmentally sustainable in the face of increasing climatic volatility. To address these challenges, I estimate microeconomic production models using both Bayesian and frequentist approaches on farm-level data to analyze how farmers allocate resources and how this shapes economic performance, environmental sustainability, and resilience.

My current research examines the economic implications of biodiversity protection and disentangles the simultaneous economic and environmental effects of weather events. The aim of my work is to provide insights for researchers and policymakers to better align farm profitability with environmental sustainability.

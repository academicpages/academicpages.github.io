:wave: Hello! I'm Nandan Thakur (नंदन ठाकुर / নন্দন ঠাকুর) [[CV]](https://thakur-nandan.github.io/files/Nandan_Thakur_CV_latest.pdf). I'm a ~~(third)~~ fourth-year PhD student at [University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) working on Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), building efficient embedding models and realistic evaluation benchmarks. I'm lucky to be advised by [Professor Jimmy Lin](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/). My PhD is partially supported by the David R. Cheriton Graduate Scholarship [[link](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/current-graduate-students/funding-and-awards/david-r-cheriton-graduate-scholarship)]. 

My research is focused on three aspects: (i) Construct challenging \& realistic benchmarks, focusing on evaluation and benchmarking (ii) Building efficient retrieval systems, whose quality and cost can be optimized and generalize well to unseen challenging domains, and (iii) Standardize RAG evaluation, which builds trust within the IR \& NLP community. 

To answer these questions, my research develops *new benchmarks* such as [BEIR](http://beir.io) or [MIRACL](http://miracl.ai) to enable realistic evaluations, and constructs *efficient models* with [GPL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11498) \& [SWIM-IR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05800). This accelerates [RAG systems](https://trec-rag.github.io) to help craft language model answers with reduced [hallucinations](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.730/) and improved accuracy seen across [domains]() and [languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13716).

I have previously interned at [Google](https://research.google/), [Vectara](https://vectara.com/) and [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/research/mosaic). I've also collaborated with industry partners including Snowflake, Micrsoft and Huawei. Previously, I worked at [UKP Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) in TU Darmstadt advised by [Professor Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/head_ukp/index.en.jsp) and [Nils Reimers](https://www.nils-reimers.de/), and KNOLSKAPE. I received my undergraduate degree from BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus in 2018.

<!-- I've been fortunate to be a part of [MIRACL](http://miracl.ai), [SWIM-IR](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/swim-ir) and similar datasets. Recently, I have been working on better evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where I am co-hosting the first ever RAG competition in TREC 2024: [TREC 2024 RAG](https://trec-rag.github.io). -->
<!-- During my PhD, I've been involved in many research collaborations, including [SnowFlake AI](https://www.snowflake.com/en/), [Vectara](https://vectara.com/) and [Huawei](http://dev3.noahlab.com.hk/). I've also been fortunate to intern at [Google Research](https://research.google/).  -->
<!-- Before my PhD, I was a research assistant at the [UKP Lab (TU Darmstadt)](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) in Germany, supervised by Prof. [Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/head_ukp/index.en.jsp) and [Nils Reimers](https://www.nils-reimers.de/) (2019 - 2021). I received my undergraduate degree at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani)](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2018. I also have industrial experience, working as a Data Scientist in [KNOLSKAPE](https://knolskape.com/) (2018 - 2019) and undergraduate internships at [EMBL Heidelberg](https://www.embl.org/sites/heidelberg/) (Summer 2018) and [Belong.co](https://belong.co/) (Fall & Winter 2017). -->

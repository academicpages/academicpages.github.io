Hi! I will be joining Alimama Ad Tech at Alibaba Group. I received my Ph.D. degree in June 2021 from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) and my B.Eng. degree in June 2016 from Wuhan University (WHU).  

Research Interests
======
My research interests are in computational advertising and information retrieval, and broader interests include transfer learning, text generation, reinforcement learning and their applications in advertising, search and recommendation. During my Ph.D., my research interests were in natural language processing and social media analytics, especially opinion mining and opinionated/argumentative text generation in low-resource (e.g., cross-domain transfer, learning with noisy labels, and sequence generation with few paired data), multi-task, multi-modal, and adversarial attack scenarios.

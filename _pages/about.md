I am currently an infrastructure engineer for the [Python Software Foundation][psf], where 
I manage and support the stability and performance of Python's infrastructure, managing infrastructure like the 
[Python Package Index (PyPI)][pypi], and supporting other globally reaching services that the PSF provides. 

I work closely with core Python committers and asset sponsors, assisting in the administration and technical operations 
of the foundation's technological assets.

Prior to joining the PSF, I was a full-stack software engineer at O'Reilly Auto Parts, where I developed and maintained 
large-scale distributed systems, implemented automation tools, built and maintained API services used by internal teams, 
and managed multiple petabyte-scale storage systems and computational infrastructure at scale.

My toolset includes things like Python, bash, Ansible, and 
[other tools and languages that you can find here][linkedin].

I am also a maintainer of the [Litestar organization][litestar-org], overseeing the development and upkeep of core 
libraries such as [Litestar][litestar], Polyfactory, and Advanced Alchemy, which collectively receive over 5.5 million 
downloads per month (at the time of writing.) These libraries are trusted by top Fortune 500 companies, 
the European Union, and American universities.

My research interests lie in the interplay between large-scale distributed systems, cloud computing, and automation. 
I am also particularly excited about learning the [Rust programming language][rust.

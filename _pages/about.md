PhD candidate in Sociology 

About me
======

I am a PhD candidate in Sociology at the University of Oxford. In my dissertation I study the Gender Pension Gap - that is the gap between the mean pension income of women compared to the mean pension income of men. I explore life course and gender senstive approaches to assess the link between gender inequalities over the life course and public policies, such as pension systems, with the Gender Pension Gap. My aim is to take into account complexities and the multidimensionality of life courses.

I obtained my BA and MA in Social Sciences from the Humboldt University of Berlin.

Research interests:
- Life course sociology
- Gender and old-age inequalities
- Family and retirement policies
- Social demography

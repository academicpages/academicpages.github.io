I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Helsinki. I consider myself a multidisciplinary human scientist. I'm interested in how cultures and technologies evolve, and how people — past and present, across cultural boundaries — have solved everyday problems. 


My work sits at the intersection of cognitive science, (cognitive) anthropology, cultural evolution, complexity science, and sustainability science. Regarding the latter, I (try to) apply my research to help preserve a more ecologically and culturally diverse world. I am a part of the [Past Present Sustainability Research Unit (PAES)](https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/organisations/past-present-sustainability-paes).


As a researcher, I am interested in the broad methodological palette, ranging from computational methods to ethnographic research. As a human, my interest is piqued by kayaking, foraging, the outdoors, [photography](https://500px.com/p/roopekaaronen?view=photos), and music. Wherever possible, I try to combine these interests: I have a firm belief that the best theory emerges from practical knowledge.


If you would like to get in touch, feel free to drop me a line. I'm always open for discussing new ideas and collaborations.

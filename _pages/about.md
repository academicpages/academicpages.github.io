I am a robotics engineer, passionate about human centric applications, the boundary between classical robotics and generative AI, bio-inspired learning and locomotion.

At [biped.ai](https://biped.ai), I led the team that built the world first autonomous walking companion for **blind & visually impaired** people, integrating 3D camera based obstacle detection, VLM powered environment and action  understanding. We reached  GTM in 3 years, and are now live in 17 countries.

I have a sweet spot for emergent behaviors, meta-heuristic optimization, reinforcement and imitation learning.

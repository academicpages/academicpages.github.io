I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.cas.cn/), working with Prof. [Jiafeng Guo](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~gjf/). I am a member of [CAS Key Lab of Web Data Science and Technology](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/). 
<!-- Prior to UIUC, I got my master's degree from [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.cas.cn/) in 2018, and received my bachelor's degree from [University of Science and Technology Beijing](http://www.ustb.edu.cn/index.asp) with Beijing Outstanding Undergraduate Award in 2015. -->
My research interests lie in the general area of Information Retrieval, with a special focus on Open-Domain Question Answering and Machine Reading Comprehension.

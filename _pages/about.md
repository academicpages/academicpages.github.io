I'm a PhD student in the [ARGO](https://www.di.ens.fr/argo/) team of [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr) Paris and [DIENS](https://www.di.ens.fr/) (computer science department of Ecole Normale Supérieure), guided by [Professor Ana Bušić](https://www.di.ens.fr/~busic/). My thesis is on Dynamic Matching Learning. I earned a Master's in Graph Theory, focusing on the [Matrix-Tree Theorem](https://kns.cnki.net/kcms/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CDMD&filename=1023784641.nh). I also studied the [family graphs with small rank](http://ccj.pku.edu.cn/article/info?aid=356769604) and [vector Laplacian on graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.05754.pdf). During this time, I collaborated with [Jianfeng Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jianfeng-Wang-15), Zoran Sanic, Weifan Wang, and others. I did my undergraduate studies in Applied Mathematics, with a focus on Linear Algebra, Number Theory, and Modern Algebra.

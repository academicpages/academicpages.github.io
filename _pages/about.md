<font size="4">I am currently an Associate Professor in the Software Engineering Institute at East China Normal University (ECNU). Before joining ECNU, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen (KU), supervised by Dr. Boris Düdder. I received my Bachelor degree in Computer Science and Ph.D degree in Computer Application Technology from Jiangsu University in 2014 and 2019, respectively, supervised by Dr. Liangmin Wang. During my Ph.D. study, I was supported by the CSC as a joint Ph.D. student joining in the School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering at Arizona State University, supervised by Dr. Guoliang Xue.</font>

**I am actively looking for self-motivated master students to conduct research on data security and privacy protection, with a specific focus on crowdsourcing/mobile crowdsensing and cloud computing. Students who are interested in blockchain-based applications and federated learning are also super welcome!** If you are interested in my research topics, please email me your CV and supporting documents. I hope you have a good Math foundation, programming, and academic writing skills.

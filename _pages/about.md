Rather be a late-bloomer than an early-finished article! I am a life-long-learning person/researcher/toastmaster, always thrive for developing not only research skills but also personal development skills.

I received the first prize at the LuxDoc Science Slam 2014 in Luxembourg for presenting my scientific, multilingual poem on Model-Driven Security.

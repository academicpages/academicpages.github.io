## Education

**University of Science, Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam**
  - BS, Mathematics & Computer Science, Advisor: [Assoc. Prof. Binh T. Nguyen](https://sites.google.com/site/ntbinhpolytechnique/home).
  - Honors Program in Mathematics and Computer Science - a highly selective program with only 30 students chosen out of 300.
  - I graduated with a GPA of 9.12/10.0 and an exceptional thesis (10.0/10.0).
  - The university is one of the best undergraduate institutes in Vietnam in Mathematics.

## Research interests

The research agenda mainly including:
 - **Self-supervised learning in the Medical Domain:** How can we utilize the self-supervised learning algorithms - learning visual representation without labeling data- to apply effectively in medical datasets? 

## Previous research experience
For my undergraduate thesis (2022), I worked on the problem of *Fall Detection*. The thesis is on the topic of *Computer Vision* as well as *Medical domain*, which interested me because I wanted to utilize the application of Computer Vision to avoid some serious injuries caused by falls in our community.

From 8/2022 to 4/2023, I was a Research Intern at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). I worked on utilizing *Self-supervised learning* for Medical data. You can find out more in my CV.

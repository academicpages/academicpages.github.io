## About me
I am a first year PhD student at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University. At present, I am located at WiTech Lab in Pittsburgh, PA, working with Prof. Swarun Kumar (fall 2022-present) on adaptive millimeter-wave sensing and next-generation applications. I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and a B.S. in Applied and Computational Mathematics from the University of Southern California, advised by Prof. Heather Culberston (spring 2020-present) and Prof. Bhaskar Krishnamachari (fall 2021-spring 2022), and Prof. Constantine Sideris (spring 2021-spring 2022).

Hi! Iâ€™m Reza, a Computer Engineering graduate student at <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/en" style="color: #0011DB; text-decoration: underline;"> Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)</a>. My research lies at the intersection of **AI hardware accelerators, reconfigurable computing, and high-level synthesis**, with applications in **real-time and embedded systems** as well as **cyber-physical systems (CPS)**.


I am particularly interested in **designing efficient and secure hardware acceleration platforms** for **neural networks and deep learning**, exploring how these systems can be optimized through FPGA-based architectures, hardware/software co-design, and advanced compilation techniques. My work often involves developing hardware-aware optimizations and dataflow architectures to improve **throughput, latency, and security** in next-generation computing systems.

Currently, I am a **research assistant at Tehran Polytechnic University**, where I contribute to projects in **AI acceleration, reconfigurable platforms, and CPS integration**.


**My Research Interests include:**
- AI Hardware Accelerator
- Reconfigurable Computing
- High Level Synthesis
- Real-time and Embedded Systems
- Cyber Physical Systems
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning

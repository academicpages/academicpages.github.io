Hi! I am currently an algorithm expert in Alimama Tech at Alibaba Group. I received my Ph.D. degree in June 2021 from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) and my B.Eng. degree in June 2016 from Wuhan University (WHU).  

Research Interests
======
My research interests are in computational advertising and information retrieval, and broader interests include transfer learning, text generation, federated learning and their applications in advertising, recommendation and search.  

During my Ph.D., my research interests were in natural language processing and social media analytics, especially opinion mining and opinionated/argumentative text generation in low-resource (e.g., cross-domain transfer, learning with noisy labels and sequence generation with few paired data), multi-task, multi-modal and adversarial attack scenarios.       


News
======
* Aug. 2022: A co-corresponding authored paper about multi-domain ranking was accepted at CIKM 2022.  
* Apr. 2022: Three first-authored papers about calibration for ranking models and ad creative generation were accepted at SIGIR 2022 and NAACL 2022.  
* Jan. 2022: A co-first authored paper about debiasing CVR estimation was accepted at WWW 2022.  
* Aug. 2021: A first-authored paper about CVR estimation via AutoML was accepted at CIKM 2021.  
* Jul. 2021: I started at Alimama Tech.

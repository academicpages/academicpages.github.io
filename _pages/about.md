I am a final year Ph.D. student in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), and expected to graduate in May 2023. I work at the intersection of materials science and machine learning. I am actively seeking full-time employment as a Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) and Data Scientist (DS).

As a computational materials scientist, I specialize in big data research. I use synchrotron x-ray imaging technique at the [Advanced Photon Source](https://www.aps.anl.gov/) to visualize laser-matter interaction in situ and in real time. By running this advanced high-speed, in-situ observation experiments, a huge amount of 2D image data are generated. I then apply statistical tools and machine learning methods to analyze the data and predict essential properties. For example, I am developing deep learning approaches to predict laser absorption using x-ray keyhole images, creating a new pathway for process-control and a real-time monitoring system of laser-based additive manufacturing. 

I possess a strong skill set in materials science, statistics, machine learning and software engineering. I am eager to bring my expertise and passion to a company where I can continue to learn and make a meaningful impact.

I'm a fourth-year PhD student from the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). My research interests include AI-assisted materials discovery and insulation for wide-bandgap power electronic devices.
I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Ying Yang](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculties/yyang.htm)
You can find my CV here: [Tengteng Niu's Curriculum Vitae](https://tntmohan.github.io/assets/CV.pdf).
I am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities starting in Fall 2026.

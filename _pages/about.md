Hello, my name is Varad. I will be joining Tata Research & Innovation Labs in September 2020. My breadth search over the past four years, resulted in me developing interests in domains at the intersection of mathematics, deep learning, and algorithm optimization. This brought me to work in the domain of Meta Learning.

I completed by Bachelors in Electronics & Communication Engineering from [Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur](https://iiitn.ac.in/) (IIITN). I worked in the domain of Algorithmic Game Theory (COMSOC, precisely) under the guidance of [Dr. Neeldhara Misra](http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~neeldhara/) at [IIT Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/). I was also fortunate to research at [HLP Lab](https://healthlanguageprocessing.org/), University of Pennsylvania supervised by [Dr. Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/graciela-gonzalez-hernandez-ms-phd) in a field at an intersection of NLP, Data mining, and AI for Healthcare. Finally, I was hosted by [Dr. Rekha Singhal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rekha-singhal-7122635/) at [Tata R&I Computing Systems Lab](https://www.tcs.com/designing-high-performing-enterprise-systems) where I researched in the domain of meta learning and algorithm optimization.

NEWS
=====
1. I will be joining Tata R&I Labs in September 2021.
2. I attended [NAACL-HLT Conference](https://aclweb.org/conference/virtual-naacl-hlt-2021-conference-registration/) at Mexico City, Mexico virtually. I also presented my work on Classification of Health Related Tweets at SMM4H Workshop, cohosted at NAACL.

Personal
=====

I was born in a serene city called Nagpur, India. I grew up listening to Itihasas (historical texts), and Puranas (Folklore). This made me to be self aware and conscious of my existence from a young age. And so, I like talking to people and visiting different places to discover my role in the greater plan of nature. Thus, it has always been my dream to travel a lot, and observe different traditions, people, and their way of living. Along, with that, I also developed interest in trekking. 

Shoot me a message anytime if you want to talk with me regarding anything! I would love to have a talk with you over a cup of coffee :relaxed:

Timeline
======

2021
-----
1. I completed a significant part of my journey this May. I successfully defended my undergraduate thesis and completed by Bachelors at IIIT Nagpur. 
2. I will be working with [Dr. Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/graciela-gonzalez-hernandez-ms-phd) and Dr. Arjun Magge on my undergraduate thesis. I will be working on **Geolocating the home addresses of Twitter Users.** A fun and exciting project, can't wait to work on it!
3. I am excited to announce that our journal paper **"Digital Image Noise Estimation using DWT Coefficients"** has been published in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, a top tier journal in Image Processing.\
DOI: [10.1109/TIP.2021.3049961](10.1109/TIP.2021.3049961) &emsp; &emsp; Impact Factor: **9.340**
4. I will be a part of the reviewing committee for the SMM4H Workshop under the banner of NAACL-HLT 2021. This is my first time doing it, thus I am planning to review with extra care :)
5. I participated in 3 shared tasks at [SMM4H Workshop](https://healthlanguageprocessing.org/smm4h-2021/), and it was fun! We were ranked in top performing teams in 2 out of the 3 shared tasks. We published our findings at the SMM4H Workshop under the banner of NAACL-HLT Conference.\

2020
-----
1. We participated in WNUT'20 shared task, and ranked 13th (accuracy-wise) all over the world! We published our methodology and findings in Proceedings of the Sixth Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text (W-NUT 2020).\
DOI: [10.18653/v1/2020.wnut-1.52](10.18653/v1/2020.wnut-1.52) &emsp; Article Link : [https://aclanthology.org/2020.wnut-1.52/](https://aclanthology.org/2020.wnut-1.52/)
2. I will be joining as a research intern at **[HLP Lab](https://healthlanguageprocessing.org/), University of Pennsylvania** under the supervision of [Dr. Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/graciela-gonzalez-hernandez-ms-phd) from July 2020 to September 2020. I will be mostly working on Social Media Mining project, which involves building natural language processing systems to automatically extract information from social media timelines.

2. I was a teaching assistant for the course **"Signals and Systems"**, taught by Dr. Ankit Bhurane. I was mainly involved in clearing doubts of students, setting questions as well as guiding them for their course projects. 
3. I was a research intern under the supervision of [Dr. Neeldhara Misra](http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~neeldhara/) at IITGN where I worked on Voting Aspects in Computational Social Science. More details can be found out [here](https://sites.google.com/view/varad-pimpalkhute/home). I was also a teaching assistant at **ACM-W Summer School on Game Theory** during my stay. 

2018
-----
1. I interned in winter as a research intern at IIT Gandhinagar under the mentorship of [Dr. Neeldhara Misra](http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~neeldhara/). I was introduced to the vast field of Algorithmic Game Theory during my stay of 2 months.  Here are some of my notes : [Fair Division](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wBqIfga0_gr7ruNWzPfPrd44Lnfqx7uk/view), [Voting Theory](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qr2OcZ7F8uCm-nffBjGOnfHINwYLV8vc/view). You can also find these lecture series particularly intriguing: Rohit Vaish's [Lecture Series on Fair Division](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRfu94TCePTvFBCeRqWLC_jEwEZhY4PLw), Edith Elkind's [Lecture Series on COMSOC](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRfu94TCePTtAgBZ36AAJ6dibrZb001yR) and Piotr Faliszewskli's [Intro to COMSOC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcnQ4p_6BFc&ab_channel=ParameterizedComplexity). I also attended the FSTTCS  Dec'2019 conference at Ahmedabad, India which was an overall amazing eye-opener experience for me.
2. Helped in building a basic but robust and fast website for [SQMS INDIA](https://sqmsindia.com/) using HTML, CSS, JavaScript frameworks.

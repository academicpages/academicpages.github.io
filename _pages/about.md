Hi there! I'm Jia Yi, a senior student in [School of Mathematical Science](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), major in Statistics.

I have a very broad interest in Statistics, Machine Learning and Quantitative Finance. Previously, I have joint several Mathematical competitions in high school, which laid me a solid foundation on Mathematics. Previously I have interned at Jane Street as Quant Trader and Citadel Securities as a Quant Researcher, and done research about mutual fund market efficiency in China by Machine Learning methods, advised by Prof. [Ruixun Zhang](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/ZhangRuixun%20/index.html). I have also visited Harvard college in 2023 Spring. Check out my [CV](https://me.jyi2002.com/files/CV_Jia.pdf) (last update: 2023.11) and [Awards](https://me.jyi2002.com/awards/) for more information!

Feel free to reach out if you have anything to chat!

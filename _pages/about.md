I am a Masters's Econ student at the [Department of Economics](https://econdse.org/) at Delhi School of Economics. I graduated from [Miranda House College, University of Delhi](https://www.mirandahouse.ac.in/), with major in Economics and minor in Mathematics, in 2020. 

I am interested in learning how and why people make decisions and then using them for important policy implications. I am assisting [Prof. Ram Singh](http://econdse.org/ramsingh/) at DSE in estimating the wealth of the selected percentiles of the Indian Wealth distributions, and [Prof. Supreet Kaur](https://www.supreetkaur.com/) and her [colleagues](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ye-rang-park-0a4a9a211/) at [CEGA, UC Berkeley](https://cega.berkeley.edu/), on multiple exciting applied behavioral econ projects! At [Dvara Research](https://www.dvara.com/research/social-protection-initiative/), I worked with the Social Protection Initiative team by analyzing rich CMIE datasets to answer questions on financial exclusion pre- and post-Covid. In the past, I assisted [Ronak Jain](https://scholar.harvard.edu/ronakjain/home) on multiple applied behavioral and experimental econ projects. Currently, I am studying possible behavioral drivers of the differences in early labor outcomes of the first-generation and non-first-generation students with [Meet Mehta](https://twitter.com/meet_econ?lang=en). This research is supported by the [Institute of Economic Growth](http://iegindia.org/). Please get in touch with me to learn more!

As a first-generation student myself, I wish to study more about intergenerational socioeconomic mobility and education in future research by using data and behavioral economics tools.

I am a big tennis fan, and love playing badminton. I also love watching movies. If you want to talk about your (or mine!) research interests, data, tennis, or movies, please [get in touch](mailto:aartimalik96@gmail.com)! I'd love to hear from you!

Thank you for visiting.

I am an Assistant Professor of Public Administration and Policy at University at Albany, SUNY. Before coming to Albany I received my PhD in Public Policy and MA in Economics from Duke University.

My research uses applied econometrics to investigate questions related to education policy, human development, and social inequality. I am particularly interested in the ways in which public school systems interact with other systems (such as criminal justice and housing) to shape long-term individual trajectories.

I teach MPA courses in public economics and public policy, and a PhD course in causal inference methods.

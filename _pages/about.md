I have strong research interests in labor economics and economics of innovation. My dissertation examines information frictions about workers in various labor markets, using novel datasets, causal inference and structural methods to quantify the impact of employer learning on labor market mobility, wages and aggregate productivity. In my job market paper, I study asymmetric employer learning in the labor market for computer scientists. 

Here is a link to my [CV]((https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator). 

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

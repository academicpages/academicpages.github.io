<!-- to quantify the impact of employer learning on labor market mobility, wages, and aggregate productivity. --> 
<!-- In my job market paper, I study asymmetric employer learning in the labor market for computer scientists. I build a dynamic framework to consider firms' endogenous investment in learning under monopsonistic competition, exploit differential timing of innovation disclosure to test for asymmetric employer learning, and quantify its impact on job mobility and innovation productivity via structural estimation. -->

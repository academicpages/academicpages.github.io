I am a student supervised by [Associate Professor Li Xiuhua](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiuhua-Li-2), currently pursuing a master's degree in control engineering at the School of Electrical Engineering, Guangxi University.
<br>
My research interests are mainly in deep learning applications in agriculture, including crop disease diagnosis, disease image generation, 3-dimensional point cloud segmentation and plant phenotype extraction, remote sensing image segmentation and object detection. 
<br>
I am also passionate about open source projects, project details can be found on [my Github page](https://github.com/dbcopper).

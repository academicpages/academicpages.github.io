Research interests focus on numerical solvers/high-performance computing (HPC) frameworks and the intersection with data-driven approaches. The applications of which have been centred within ocean and atmospheric modelling settings. Extensive experience to date has focused on tsunami modelling, where the severe time constraints placed on a tsunami warning centre act as a driving force to develop techniques which operate in real-time. An open-source massively parallelised tsunami model has been developed. This numerical solver has been coupled with a statistical emulator to quantify uncertainty on the tsunami hazard in a real-time warning setting. Machine learning techniques have been leveraged to capture localised effects from computationally cheap regional forecasts. Recent efforts to couple an open-source particle filtering data assimilation code with a simplified atmospheric model exemplifies this continued interest in the link between HPC numerics and data driven approaches. Initial research into the interplay between statistical learning techniques and numerics (The Unified Model of the Met Office) is being explored, where Multi-Output Gaussian Processes provide distributions on atmospheric variables which in turn influence the numerics.

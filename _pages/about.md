Hi there! I am Fazilet, currently working on a mobile app development project. I have a special interest in machine learning implementations for signal processing problems. I also enjoy following the developments in communications technologies. 

I have been involved in two different research projects so far. One is about molecular communications, where we designed a novel molecular communications system. In the end, we published the results in IEEE-TMBMC. The other is for my master's dissertation, which is on the super-resolution (SR) problem. I implemented different SR techniques and analyzed the results from a signal processing perspective (For details, visit [Projects](https://faziletgokbudak.github.io/projects/)).

I am a female electronics engineer from Turkey, who don't really like being addressed as Mr Gokbudak! Except for Turkey, I have lived in Germany for around seven months as a summer school and exchange student. Also, I studied my master's in the UK at the University of Edinburgh. You can find my educational experiences about these countries in [Blog Posts](https://faziletgokbudak.github.io/year-archive/).

Welcome to my website!

I am the Knowledge Transfer Leader at the **Centre for Data Analysis, Modelling and Computational Sciences** [CAMINO](https://www.uni.lodz.pl/en/centre-for-data-analysis-modelling-and-computational-sciences-camino) at the **University of Łódź**, Poland. I am also based in the Department of Ecology & Vertebrate Zoology at University of Łódź and additionally work at the **Institute of Vertebrate Biology** of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic. 

I was formerly Reader in Zoology at the **University of St Andrews**, UK and held lectureships at the **University of Leicester**, UK and **Queen Mary College** of the University of London. Before my first lectureship, I held a research fellowship at the **University of East Anglia**, UK, worked as a fish ecologist at **Plymouth Marine Laboratory**, UK, served as an aid worker in Bangladesh, and worked for the **Food and Agriculture Organisation** of the United Nations. I completed a PhD on fish ecology at the **University of Aberystwyth**, UK and I am the author of over 130 scientific papers and four books.

My research interests are in fish and marine ecology, evolutionary and behavioural ecology, statistical modelling, and in applying informative Bayesian priors to ecological and evolutionary models. I regularly run free online statistics workshops, and you are welcome to contact me to discuss courses tailored to your specific research group or institute.

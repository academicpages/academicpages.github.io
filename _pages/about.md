I am a Marie Curie research fellow for [POLISS](https://poliss.eu/) project and a 
PhD candidate at Utrecht University in the Department of Human Geography and Spatial Planning. My PhD thesis investigates the impact of artificial intellligenceon labour market inequalities and the future of work. 

I graduated from Master in Public Administration degree 
from London School of Economics and Political Science specialising in Public and Economic Policy. 
Before joining Utrecht, I worked with academia and international organisations (UNDP, EBRD) on digitalisation, 
climate change, and gender equality.

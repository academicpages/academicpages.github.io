I'm a Computer Science Ph.D student working with [Rahul Chatterjee](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~chatterjee/) in the [MadS&P Research Group](https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/).
I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the Univeristy of Michigan-Ann Arbor.

I am researching the security needs of at-risk populations, focusing on the survivors of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV).

If you want to reach out to me, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:ceccio@wisc.edu).

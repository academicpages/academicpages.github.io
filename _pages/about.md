My internship at Technical University of Munich
------
My current engagement as a visiting student researcher in CAMP at the Technical University of Munich, under the guidance of Professor Nassir Navab, has been transformative. Focused on 3D vessel segmentation and counterfactual modeling using vision-linguistic models, these projects underscore my dedication to advancing knowledge at the intersection of computer vision and deep learning.

During my internship, I had the valuable opportunity to attend the ICCV 2023 conference in Paris. This experience allowed me to engage with a diverse group of leading scientists, Ph.D. students, and professors in the field. The insights gained from these interactions enriched my understanding of current trends in computer vision and AI, emphasizing the importance of collaborative learning and international networking for scientific progress.


My Research Journey at Sharif University of Technology
======
My academic endeavors continued at the Sharif University of Technology, working in the RIML lab with Professor Mohammad Hossein Rohban on Vision-Linguistic Models and Robustness. This collaboration led to the submission of a research paper to ICLR 2024, illustrating my dedication to contributing to the academic discourse. The experience of collaborating on this project was not just about academic learning; it was an exercise in patience and perseverance.

The process of writing and submitting our research paper to ICLR 2024 was transformative. Over 10 months, I engaged deeply with the subject matter, applying mathematical precision and an in-depth understanding of advanced models and architectures. This phase was critical in enhancing my theoretical knowledge and practical implementation skills, teaching me the importance of persistence in research.


My Academic Journey at University of Isfahan
======
My academic journey commenced University of Isfahan. My transformative moment occurred during an artificial intelligence course in the second semester, marking the genesis of my fervor for the field. This newfound interest catalyzed a significant improvement in my GPA, surpassing 18 in subsequent semesters. Subsequently, I embarked on a rewarding research career at the laboratory of one of my professors, solidifying my resolve to advance the frontiers of knowledge.

The journey unfolded through diverse research experiences across esteemed institutions. At the University of Isfahan, under Dr. Peyman Adibi's guidance, I delved into Zero-shot Learning in the medical domain, utilizing Geometric Deep Learning. This exploration aimed to unify Zero-shot modalities, demonstrating my dedication to addressing real-world challenges through innovative approaches.

A significant milestone in my early research career was the opportunity to present my work on Zero-shot Learning during the universityâ€™s research week. This event, typically a platform for the university's most esteemed researchers, allowed me to share my insights and findings with a knowledgeable audience of master's and Ph.D. students. This presentation was a testament to the advanced level of my work and my emerging reputation as a promising researcher in the field.


My startup Journey
======
My entrepreneurial experience has been instrumental in shaping my approach to research and problem- solving. Founding a startup provided deep insights into project management, resource allocation, and team dynamics, enhancing my leadership skills and pragmatic problem-solving abilities. This journey, recognized with a top rank in a summer business school, has endowed me with a strategic mindset and a holistic perspective. As I embark on this next phase in academia, I am eager to apply these lessons and innovative approaches to contribute significantly to your Ph.D. program, enriching both my academic pursuits and the collaborative research environment at your institution.

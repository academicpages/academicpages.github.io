Research Interests
======
My current interests lie in statistical machine learning and computational data science with an emphasis on explainability and responsibility. I am most interested in applying these tools to model, better-understand, and improve environmental and social systems.

Current and Recent Projects
======
### Interpretable Machine Learning and Amazonian Deforestation
*Yale School of the Environment, January 2022-Present*

Building interpretable machine learning models to understand and predict where deforestation occurs in the Brazilian Amazon under [Dr. Luke Sanford](https://lcsanford.github.io) and [Dr. Kathryn Baragwanath](https://kathrynbaragwanath.com)
<br/><br/>

### Interpreting Neural Network Concept Discovery with Non Negative Matrix Factorization
*August 2022*

Applying NMF with Convolutional Neural Networks for interpretability with applications to medical diagnoses, particularly novel diseases such as monkeypox

### Topic Modeling with Non Negative Matrix Factorization and Knowledge Graphs
*UCLA Department of Mathematics, June 2022-August 2022*

Uncovering latent information in data from Los Angeles community partners with NMF and KGE

I'm a Post-Doc Researcher at Jeju National University in South Korea.

My research interests are 
-> Underwater acoustic monitoring of coastal water
-> Bottlenose dolphin vocalization and behavior 
-> Biomedical application of Ultrasound (ultrasound imaging and Focused Ultrasound)
-> Deep learning, Signal, and image processing

# Professional Experiences
======
My professional research experience began with an internship at the Focused Ultrasound Foundation (Charlottesville, VA, US) in 2016. I worked as an Assistant Researcher with Dr. John Snell on the development of an open-source toolkit for transcranial-focused ultrasound targeting.

After completing my Ph.D., I joined the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Medical Innovation Foundation (Daegu, South Korea) as a researcher in 2017. I gained valuable field experience in hardware and software development, as well as experiment design for medical applications of focused ultrasound.

In 2019, I embarked on a new journey in my research career at the DGIST-ETH Microrobot Research Center (Daegu, South Korea) as a Post-Doctoral researcher. My main focus at DGIST was the development of a cell stimulation transducer using MEMS technology. I also led the development of a contractility analysis system using deep learning.

Another round of discovery in a new research field began when I returned to Jeju National University in 2021. Since then, I have been closely working with Prof. Paeng on underwater acoustics. Currently, I am focused on the vocalization and behavior monitoring of wild dolphins.

I am very excited about my current research topic and am working diligently to publish as many journal articles as possible to expand our knowledge of these remarkable creatures.

Please contact me if you are interested in collaboration or require any assistance from me.

Hello! My name is Qirong Yang, and I am currently an undergraduate student in Software Engineering at East China Normal University. I will pursue my master's degree at Zhejiang University under the supervision of Prof. Kun Kuang. My primary research interests focus on causal inference and large language models (LLMs).

I am passionate about exploring the intersection of causal reasoning and machine learning, aiming to enhance the interpretability and adaptability of AI systems. My future work will focus on integrating causal inference into the development and optimization of large models to address complex challenges effectively.

I look forward to connecting with like-minded researchers and collaborating on exciting projects. Feel free to reach out to share insights or discuss potential research opportunities!

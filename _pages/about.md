I am currently a Ph.D. student at the CSE Department, the HKUST, advised by [Prof. Qiang Yang](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~qyang/) and co-advised by [Prof. Kai Chen](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~kaichen). My research interests lie in data mining algorithms for practical problems, including: 
- **Expressive Learning Models**
    - **Structure-Aware Models for Graph Data** \[GraLSP, AAAI'20; GraphSTONE, KDD'20; GraphMSE, AAAI'21; GSKN, WWW'21\]
    - **Temporal-Aware Models under Dynamic Data** \[EPNE, ECAI'20\]
- **Effective Learning under the Lack of Data**
    - **Transfer Learning** \[TransGTR, KDD'23; CrossTReS, KDD'22; MUSDAC, IJCAI'20\]
    - **Federated Learning** \[SecureBoost, IEEE Intel. Sys. 2021; GeniBatch, EuroSys'24\]

Prior to joining the HKUST, I spent 4 wonderful years at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), China, obtaining both a B.S in Computer Science and a B.Economics at the National School of Development. I was fortunate to have [Prof. Guojie Song](https://gjsong-pku.cn) as my advisor during my days at PKU, with whom I collaborate very well.

Miscellaneous
======
I hold a broad range of interests so as to keep enjoying life. 

I enjoy sports including jogging and basketball. My favourite team in NBA is San Antonio Spurs and my favourite football club is Liverpool FC. 

I am a civil aviation enthusiast. I am a member of the ACICFG, a team devoted to making subtitles and captions for documentaries related to civil aviation (such as the **Air Crash Investigation**). Some of our works are published on [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/358422). I also write some articles on [zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/mai-kang-ming/activities) related to civil aviation and my research. 

I am an alcoholist, I like the following types of alcohol. 

- Beers, including Pale Ale (I like **Ballast Point**, **Brooklyn**, **Dogfish** and **BrewDog**.), Trappist (I like **Rochefort** and **Chimay**.) and Hefeweizen (I think **Franziskaner** is good enough.). 

- Vodka. **Smirnoff Black, Grey Goose and Russian Standards** are of high quality.

- Whiskey. For single malts, I like **Talisker and Lagavulin**. For blended, **Johnnie Walker Double Black** is worth a try. 

- Bourbon. I have only tried **Maker's Mark** and I found it charming. Recently I tried **Wild Turkey 101**. I found it more straight and less mild than Maker's Mark, but still interesting. 

- Gin. The taste of Gin is a highly personalized matter. I would recommend **the Botanists** and **Monkey 47**. 

An image demonstrating genres of single malt scotch is [here](http://kl4805.github.io/files/Whiskey.jpeg).

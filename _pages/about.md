I am an epidemiologist, modeler, and multidisciplinary data scientist with
experience in infectious disease, microbiome science, microbiology, antibiotic
resistance, statistics, computing, and mathematical modeling. I have developed
skill sets in facilitation, technical communication, and project management.

## Work history

I work at [Biobot Analytics](https://www.biobot.io) as a Computational
Epidemiologist, connecting wastewater-based data streams with public health
actions. Biobot currently performs COVID-19 monitoring for places
like [Boston, MA](https://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm).

During COVID-19, I was a part-time Research Analyst in the [Center for Public Health
Preparedness and Resilience](https://www.cna.org/centers/ipr/phpr/) in the
[Institute for Public Research](https://www.cna.org/centers/ipr/) at
[CNA](https://www.cna.org/). CNA is a nonprofit research institute that
provides objective analysis to Federal, state, and local government. At CNA,
my work has focused on advising US Navy, Federal agencies, and state and city
officials, especially on COVID-19.

As an independent epidemiological consultant with Dr. [Yonatan
Grad](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/yonatan-grad/), I co-designed a model used
to inform the design of the National Basketball Association's "bubble"
for the 2020 play-offs.

Before COVID-19, I was Scientific Director at
[OpenBiome](http://www.openbiome.org), a non-profit stool bank based in
Boston. OpenBiome provides material for fecal microbiota transplantation
(FMT) for use in treating *C. difficile* infection and for research.

## Educational background

I did my postdoctoral training with [Yonatan
Grad](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/yonatan-grad/) at the Harvard Chan School
of Public Health, where I focused on antimicrobial resistance, and my PhD
with [Eric Alm](http://almlab.mit.edu/) at MIT, where I worked in
environmental microbiology, human microbiome science, and clinical trial
design.

At MIT, I was a founding member of MIT's [Biological Engineering
Communciation Lab](http://bewritinglab.mit.edu/), where I co-led the
development of the first [CommKit](http://mitcommlab.mit.edu/be/), a guide to
communication tasks designed by scientists for scientists. I was also a
founding member of the MIT [Biological Engineering REFS](http://berefs.com/),
a peer-to-peer conflict management and mentoring program, and a Diversity
Chair on the department's graduate student board. During my postdoc I served
as the President of the [Harvard Chan Postdoc
Association](http://hsph.me/pda) and served on the School's Committee for
Diversity and Inclusion.

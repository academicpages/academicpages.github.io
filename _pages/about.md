Welcome to my webpage! 

I finished my PhD at the University of Melbourne, working under the supervision of [Dr. Sarah Erfani](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/smonazam/) and [Prof. Christopher Leckie](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/6335-christopher-leckie). Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow in machine learning at the University of Melbourne node of ARC Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making & Society (ADM+S). I am contributing to ADM+S Center’s Machines Research Program. My research entails developing algorithms that enable a systematic treatment of bias and unfairness in AI and automated decision-making.

Mesmerized by generative models, I try to formulate various problems through the lens of generative modeling and bring that statistical perspective to them. In this area, I have an expertise with
* Normalizing Flows
* Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
* Probabilistic Diffusion Models (Score Matching)

Besides my in-depth experience with generative modeling, I have worked and am interested in the following areas:

* Adversarial Machine Learning (Adversarial/Backdoor Robustness/Attack)
* Coreset Selection
* Compressed Sensing
* 3D Reconstruction

I am always happy to discuss research-related topics. Just shoot me an email! :)

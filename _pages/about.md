# About Me
Currently, I am a Research Fellow in the [Machine Teaching Group](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html) at [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), where I have the great fortune to be advised by Dr. [Adish Singla](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html). My primary research interest lies in exploring the theory and practice of machine learning. I'm also curious in understanding the non-convex optimization of Deep learning.<br>

I got my BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science (2013-2016) and MSc in Computer Science (2016-2018) from [Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI, India)](https://www.cmi.ac.in/).
After that, I was a graduate student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-computer-science) at [Aalto Univerity (Finland)](https://www.aalto.fi/en) from September 2018 to August 2019.

Future Projects
======
In the future, I would like to conduct academic research and earn a doctorate degree, so I hope I will be able to fill this website with talks, publications etc. Feel free to explore its primordial form and make any suggestion! I am also interested in having multiple job experiences, so I am happy to consider any offer and actively apply for interesting positions!

Next steps in my career will be earning my Masters' degree in Data Science and a doctorate degree. I am currently strenghtening my theoretical knowledge towards this goal. 

About me & not in my CV
======
Born and raised in a small town with a big identity in the Milan metropolitan area. Atteded a Scientific oriented high school in Milan, to later move to one of the most prestigious (if not the most prestigious) Economics Universities in Italy. In the free time, I enjoy deepening my understanding of what I am studying, spending valuable time alone, seeing friends, cycling, drinking coffee, doing sports, listening to the radio or expanding my music collection.

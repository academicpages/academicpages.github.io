I am currently studying to become a mechanical engineer at RWTH Aachen, but I am most pationate about control theory and programming. I started off coding in MATLAB by teaching the courses "Introduction to MATLAB" and "Simulation using MATLAB and Simulink" for the IT Center RWTH Aachen. 

Afterwards I completed an internship at BMW as a software developer at the Vehicle Dynamics Division. I mainly worked on the MBSE Toolchain, the main tool used at BMW to generate C-Code for ECUs from Simulink models. In this capacity I gained experience working with JAVA, Python and Bazel.

Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in the [Intelligent Automation Research Group](https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/engineering/research/research-groups/intelligent-automation-research-group) at RMIT University, Australia, advised by [Prof. Alireza Bab-Hadiashar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-bab-hadiashar-0a881a31/), [Prof. Reza Hoseinnezhad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rezahn/) and [Dr Ruwan Tennakoon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruwan-tennakoon-923a3437/). 

My Ph.D. research focuses on the topic of <b>machine learning (ML)</b> and <b>computer vision (CV)</b> for autonomous robotic applications. In addition, I also have experience in the following topics/frameworks: 
* [ML] representation learning, domain adaptation and generalisation, Bayesian deep learning, information theory, generative modelling, and adversarial learning; 
* [CV] stereo matching and depth estimation, semantic/panoptic segmentation, optical flow, image classification, object detection and localisation, and image synthesis;
* [Tool] PyTorch, TensorFlow, Python, Jupyter, Git.

I am also currently working as a <b>tutor</b> and <b>lab demonstrator</b> for the Machine Learning and Deep Learning at RMIT University, in 2021 and 2022. Formerly, I have also worked as a <b>lab demonstrator</b> and <b>teaching assistant</b> for two other subjects: Digital Fundamental and Introduction to Mechatronics. 

Previously, I have also worked in other areas such as 
* simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) as my final year project for my bachelor's degree; 
* robot manipulator design for adaptive object gripping; 
* parachute and recovery system design for model rockets; 
* sensor fusion using multiple RGB-D (Microsoft Kinects) cameras and an infrared camera for an industry project.

I am passionate about acquiring new knowledge and delivering novel solutions developed from theoretical research to solve practical industrial problems. I also very much enjoy teaching&#128214;, doing research&#128187;, and drinking coffee&#9749;.

Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography, co-advised by [Caroline Ummenhofer](https://ummenhofer.whoi.edu/) and [Delia Oppo](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/doppo/). My PhD research is focused on understanding low-frequency (decadal to centennial timescales) climate variability in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans as well as related impacts on the hydrological cycle. I am broadly interested in paleoclimate, atmospheric and ocean circulation, tropical basin-interactions, and hydroclimate extremes.

I received my Bachelors in Chemistry from Columbia University in 2018. Outside of research, I enjoy playing tennis, skiing in the winter, and rock climbing.

I am a PhD student working with [Dr. Brian Levine](https://levinelab.weebly.com/) at Baycrest, University of Toronto. My primary interest lies in perception and memory using a cognitive computational neuroscience approach.

Previously, I was a master's student at UChicago working with [Dr. Wilma Bainbridge](https://brainbridgelab.uchicago.edu/) and [Dr. Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/) examining the predictability of memorability neural pattern and attention network on memory performance using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Besides that, I also employed deep learning and natural language processing techniques to examine [the influence of image memorability on social media virality](
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.14659). During my undergrad, I worked with Dr. Peter Dixon on examining the [relationship between mind wandering and cognitive coupling](https://doi.org/10.1037/cep0000349); I also worked with [Dr. Peggy St Jacques](https://sites.psych.ualberta.ca/MElab/) on investigating the influence of dimensionality on vividness of event-related episodic memory in virtual reality (VR) environment.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking multiple cuisines or playing some video games (I am a Pokemon fan!!!! Though you may have known from my GitHub profile haha).

If you are interested in any collaboration, feel free to send me an email!

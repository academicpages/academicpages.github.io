### üìÑ Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers

I have experience with independent research through implementing fundamental deep learning architectures from scratch. I have implemented the **Transformer Architecture** from the seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017), building every core component from basic PyTorch modules to understand the underlying mechanisms.

**Key Implementation Features:**

- **From-scratch development**: Built all components including Multi-Head Self-Attention, Positional Encoding, Encoder-Decoder layers, and masking mechanisms without using high-level abstractions
- **End-to-end pipeline**: Implemented complete workflow from data preprocessing (Multi30k German-English dataset) to model training and inference
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Provided detailed comments explaining tensor shapes, architectural decisions, and the purpose of each operation
- **Practical application**: Demonstrated the model's effectiveness on neural machine translation tasks

The implementation is contained in a well-structured Jupyter notebook that serves as both a learning resource and a functional translation system. This project showcases my ability to understand complex research papers and translate theoretical concepts into working code.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the [Notion blog](https://www.notion.so/Attention-is-all-you-need-explained-22de89630a7680f4a7b7feb57d52cff4?source=copy_link) communicating the paper's theory and my results.

### ü§ñ RAG Chatbot Application Development

I have developed a comprehensive RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot application that demonstrates advanced conversational AI capabilities. This project features:

- **Document-based conversation**: Users can upload documents that are indexed and stored in a vector database for contextual responses
- **Chat history management**: Configured prompt engineering to maintain conversation context across multiple interactions
- **Multi-model support**: Integration with Gemini-1.5-flash and other language models with easy model switching
- **Full-stack implementation**:
  - Frontend built with React.js running on localhost:3000
  - Backend API server using FastAPI/Uvicorn on localhost:8000
  - Docker containerization for easy deployment
- **Vector search integration**: Documents are processed and stored in vectorstore for efficient retrieval during conversations
- **Persistent chat sessions**: Users can create new conversations or return to previous chat histories

The application combines retrieval-augmented generation with conversational memory, allowing for more contextually aware and document-grounded responses. This project showcases practical implementation of modern NLP techniques in a production-ready chatbot interface.

  - Implemented multiple model architectures (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, Bidirectional LSTM)
  - Achieved 91.30% accuracy with LSTM model on IMDB dataset
  - Integrated MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry
  - Implemented distributed training with Ray framework
  - Automated hyperparameter optimization using Optuna (100+ trials)
  - Data versioning and validation with DVC and Great Expectations

- **Containerization & API Deployment (Phase 2)**:

  - Built production-ready FastAPI service with interactive web interface
  - Multi-stage Docker containerization for optimized deployment
  - REST API endpoints with automatic documentation (Swagger UI)
  - Docker Hub publishing with automated CI/CD deployment scripts
  - Health checks and error handling for production reliability

- **Monitoring & Observability (Phase 3)**:
  - Complete monitoring stack: Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager
  - Infrastructure monitoring: CPU, memory, disk I/O, network metrics via Node Exporter
  - Application monitoring: Request rates, error rates, latency percentiles
  - Model monitoring: Inference speed, confidence scores, prediction distributions
  - Centralized logging: Loki + Promtail for multi-source log aggregation
  - Automated alerting: Configurable thresholds for error rates, resource usage, model confidence

**Technical Stack:**

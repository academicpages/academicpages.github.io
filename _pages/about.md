Hi! My name is Marcelo Gennari and I am a Senior Researcher at Microsoft! Previously I attended the University of Oxford where I got first my M.Eng in 2018, and then my DPhil (that's the same as a PhD) in 2022 at the [Active Vision Lab](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/about/active-vision-laboratory/) surpervised by [Prof. Victor Prisacariu](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/victor-prisacariu/). 

My research during my graduate studies was focused on compressing neural networks, especially CNNs, to make them run faster and using less memory on especialised hardware, in particular FPGAs. It was a project in close collaboration with the sponsors of my DPhil, [Omnitek (now acquired by Intel)](https://www.anandtech.com/show/14215/intel-acquires-omnitek-fpga-video-acceleration-and-inferencing), and my co-supervisor [Dr. Roger Fawcett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-fawcett-568ba51b/?originalSubdomain=uk). 

During my time at Microsoft I have been continuing this work by focusing on various methods of compressing neural networks. I have so far worked on (1) distillation, pruning, and quantization of super resolution networks for accelerated inference in the edge; (2) network pruning of large language models; (3) compression of diffusion models for real-time image generation in the edge.

If you are interested in my research or wants to collaborate, don't hesitate to send me an email

During biology classes in high school most of the students get the chance to see the structure of onion tissue. The way that onion cells are connect to each other might lead to the wrong idea of how tissue are organised. Our body is made of different tissues, with different properties. Different cells form different tissues. However, not only cells are responsible for such differences. <b>Living tissues are more than packed cells.</b>

Like the cement that keeps bricks in a wall, cells use a complex meshwork of sugars, water, minerals and proteins to hold together as a tissue. As these materials fill up the space in-between the cells, it is designated by <b>extracellular matrix (ECM)</b>. Besides providing a structure support to the cells, the ECM plays a crucial role in several cellular processes, such as cell survival, development, adhesion and differentiation of stem cells.<br>
In my research use <b>cutting edge microscopy to understand the role of physical forces in cellular behaviour</b>.

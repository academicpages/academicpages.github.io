I am a PhD candidate in mechanical engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) where I am advised by [Francesco Bullo](http://motion.me.ucsb.edu/). I was awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship in Spring 2021. I am broadly interested in studying machine learning tools such as neural networks and optimizers from the viewpoint of dynamical systems and control theory. In Spring 2020, I graduated with a B.S. in mechanical engineering and a B.S. in mathematics from the University of Maryland (UMD). While at UMD, I worked with [Yancy Diaz-Mercado](https://eng.umd.edu/clark/faculty/900/Yancy-Diaz-Mercado) on multi-robot coverage control and its applications. 

While an undergraduate student at UMD, I worked internships at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, MIT Lincoln Lab, and The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab. 

Outside of academics, I am a competitive chess player with titles of chess expert and candidate master and a US Chess Federation [rating of 2162](http://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?13928690). I am also an ultramarathon distance runner, having run a 50 mile race (and hoping to run other long-distance events in the future).

<b>Recent Updates</b>

* June 2023: Our 2022 ACC article "Non-Euclidean Contractivity of Recurrent Neural Networks" ([link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9867357)) with Anton Proskurnikov and Francesco Bullo, received the 2023 O. Hugo Schuck Best Paper Award from the American Automatic Control Council!
* May 2023: We posted a preprint on [Contracting Dynamics for Time-Varying Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15595) - read about how we can use contraction theory to track optimal trajectories in time-varying optimization problems!

Welcome to my page! 

I am a postdoctoral fellow in Daniel Baumann's group at [LeCosPA](https://www.lecospa.ntu.edu.tw), National Taiwan University in Taipei.
Until October 2024, I worked as a PhD student with Andrew J. Tolley at Imperial College London.
For more details, see my [CV](../files/cv.pdf).

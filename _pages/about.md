Ezekiel Soremekun is a Lecturer (Asst. Prof.) in Computer Science (Software Engineering) at 
[Royal Holloway, University of London (RHUL)](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/), UK. 


Professional Experience
-----------------------
Ezekiel Soremekun was previously a Research Scientist 
at the [SerVal Group](https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt/research/serval) 
(led by Prof. Dr. Yves Le Traon), 
[SnT](https://wwwen.uni.lu/snt) 
-- Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust, 
at the 
[University of Luxembourg](https://wwwen.uni.lu), Luxembourg. 
Before then, he was a researcher (and PhD candidate) at the [Software Engineering Research Group](https://andreas-zeller.info) 
(of Prof. Dr. Andreas Zeller) at 
[CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en), [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html).
He was also a visiting researcher at the 
[Automated Systems SEcuriTy (ASSET) Research Group](https://asset-group.github.io) 
(of Prof. Dr. Sudipta Chattopadhyay) at 
[SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg) -- Singapore University of Technology and Design. 

Education
---------
Ezekiel has a
PhD in Software Engineering (2021) from 
[Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html). 
He was a graduate student (2013-2016) at the 
[Saarbrücken Graduate School of Computer Science](https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de).
He also obtained an
MSc in Computer Science (2011) from 
[African University of Science and Technology](https://aust.edu.ng)
and a BSc in Software Engineering (2010) from
[American University of Nigeria](https://www.aun.edu.ng).


Research
-------------------
Ezekiel's research is primarily focused on **software engineering** (SE), especially **software validation**, i.e., validating software quality.
This includes SE research concerns such as **automated debugging**, **software testing**, 
**program analysis**, and **security testing**. 
He is interested in studying both functional properties (e.g., correctness)
and non-functional properties (e.g., security, robustness, and fairness) of 
software systems, including artificial intelligence (AI) -driven systems (e.g., automated classifiers). 

Ezekiel's research objective is to **apply scientific methods to validate software systems**. 
His main research goal is to address key challenges in software validation by **developing methods and tools to support developers during software testing and debugging activities**.

The over-arching research aim is to provide useful validation techniques, tools and empirical studies for the following:
   * __Software Testing & Analysis__: *systematic generation of test inputs* to expose unexpected program behaviors (see (ASE17)[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8115639], (TSE20)[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9154602], (TOSEM22)[https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3530786]), 
   * __Automated Debugging__: how to *automatically diagnose, mitigate and repair* incorrect program behaviors (see [ICSE20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3377811.3380329), [FSE20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3368089.3409687), [ISSTA20](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3395363.3397349)), 
   * __Human Factors in SE__: studying and accounting for *developer behaviors* during (automated) software testing and debugging activities (see [ESEC/FSE17](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3106237.3106255), [EMSE21](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-020-09931-7), [ICSE23](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10172588)), and 
  # * __Human-in-the-loop SE__: building testing and debugging tools that *account for developer behaviors, needs 
and interactions in software practice*. 
   * __AI4SE & SE4AI__: application of SE techniques (e.g., testing and debugging) to address AI concerns and the application of AI methods to address SE tasks (see [TSE22](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9678017), [MSR22](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3524842.3528456), [COSE23](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404823000111)).

Welcome! I am a PhD student in the Political Science department at UCLA. My research interests are in Political Economy. Specifically, I study economic reform, sovereign debt politics, and distributive politics. My methodological interests include the application and development of Causal Inference, Machine Learning, Bayesian techniques, and Time Series. You may contact me at mwidmann@ucla.edu.

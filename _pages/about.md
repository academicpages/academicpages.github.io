Welcome! My name is **Solaiman**. I am a full time faculty member and a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at [University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC)](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/). My research expertise revolve around multimodal data management and uncertainty management in real-world AI systems using Machine Learning. I earned my Ph.D. and M.Sc. in Computer Science from [**Purdue University**](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/), West Lafayette, IN, under the supervision of Prof. [Bharat Bhargava](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bb/).

During my time at Purdue, I worked on the [REALM](https://news.northropgrumman.com/news/releases/northrop-grumman-launches-new-research-consortium-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning) project funded by NGC and the SAIL-ON project funded by DARPA. I worked closely with Prof. [Michael Stonebraker](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/michael-stonebraker) for the REALM/SKOD project and contributed in scalable Multimodal Information Retrieval and Video and Text Feature Extraction. 
<!-- During the SAIL-ON project, I worked closely with Josh Alspector and rest of the Novelty Working Group (NWG) team on theories of novelty, including novelty detection, adaptation, and characterization in perception and planning domains. -->
<!--  -->
I also served as a faculty member at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology ([AUST](https://www.aust.edu/cse)) and United International University ([UIU](https://www.uiu.ac.bd/)) from 2014 to 2016. 
<!-- My B.Sc. dissertation titled [‘Minimal Parameter Clustering of Complex Shaped Variable-sized Dataset (MPCACS)’](/files/publications/ug-thesis-2014.pdf) focused on unsupervised learning of complex datasets. -->

My research intersects with machine learning, multimodal information retrieval, open-world learning, and
data management systems. I built systems and techniques to enable scalable and robust multimodal data
processing in open-world environment, while working with practical applications and end users. 
<!-- Combining insights
from computer vision, nlp, representation learning, and information retrieval, I design techniques to enable practical
cross-modal retrieval system via feature-centered knowledge accumulation. -->
Additionally, I also focused on 
acquiring fundamental insights that facilitate dependable open-world learning, which can operate securely and
flexibly in the presence of dynamic and unforeseen data streams. My work has appeared in top machine learning and database conferences and journals such as IEEE Computer, Artificial Intelligence, VLDB, SIGMOD, AAAI, and IEEE TransAI.  I have collaborated with multiple industry and academic partners
such as WLPD, USC-ISI, IDA, METU, MIT, NGC, USC, and DARPA.

<!-- If you are interested in working with me and/or you are already a graduate student at UMBC, feel free to reach out. Undergraduate students can also reach out to me for senior thesis advising or independent work. I also recommend you take at least one of the Machine Learning or NLP or Deep Learning classes before getting into multimodal information retrieval or representation learning. -->

<!-- Welcome! My name is **Solaiman**. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science 
 from [**Purdue University**](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/), where my research centered on Multimodal Information Extraction and Situation-aware data recommendation in real-world applications. 
(http://purdue.edu/)
I was advised by Prof. [Bharat Bhargava](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bb/). 
During my Ph.D., I have worked closely with Prof. [Michael Stonebraker](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/michael-stonebraker) for the [REALM/SKOD](https://news.northropgrumman.com/news/releases/northrop-grumman-launches-new-research-consortium-for-artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning) project. -->
<!-- the A.M. Turing Award recipient Michael Stonebraker. -->
<!-- I earned my M.Sc. in Computer Science from Purdue University and my B.Sc. in [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) from [Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/) ([B.Sc. Dissertation](/files/publications/ug-thesis-2014.pdf)).  -->
<!-- I also served as a faculty member at Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology ([AUST](https://www.aust.edu/cse)) and United International University ([UIU](https://www.uiu.ac.bd/)). -->

<!-- My research interests revolve around heterogeneous data management in general, 
but the application areas of my work have been interdisciplinary, spanning from data discovery and novelty management to 
multimodal information retrieval, natural language processing, and video feature extraction. In collaboration with non-academic parties (e.g., West Lafayette Police Department, NGC), my systems are inspired by real-world use cases. 
<br>
I am interested in designing mechanisms for identifying patterns and novelties in heterogeneous data sources towards better understanding of the data, focusing on the explanability of the models to better use them for situational awareness.  -->

Bio
======
I am a Research Assistant Professor in the Urban Governance and Design Thrust Area, Society Hub at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). I received my Ph.D. in Demography from Princeton University in September 2021. I completed my B.A. (2013) and M.A. (2016) in Economics at Peking University. My research uses quantitative methods to examine dynamics between societal demographic processes and individual decisions about migration, marriage, fertility, and living arrangements.

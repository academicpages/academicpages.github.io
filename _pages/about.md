I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Harvard Economics. I study questions in labor, personnel, and innovation. 

Currently I investigate information frictions about talent in the labor market, and the role of firms in identifying talent in various empirical contexts.

<!-- to quantify the impact of employer learning on labor market mobility, wages, and aggregate productivity. --> 
<!-- In my job market paper, I study asymmetric employer learning in the labor market for computer scientists. I build a dynamic framework to consider firms' endogenous investment in learning under monopsonistic competition, exploit differential timing of innovation disclosure to test for asymmetric employer learning, and quantify its impact on job mobility and innovation productivity via structural estimation. --> 

I will join the UW-Madison Economics Department as a postdoctoral fellow 2024-2025, and then as an assistant professor in August 2025.

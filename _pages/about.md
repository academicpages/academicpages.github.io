About Me
======
Hi, I'm Fang Gong. I recieved my Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering from China University of Geosciences (CUG-Wuhan) in Dec 2022, supervised by prof. [Liangxiao Jiang](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/jlx/zh_CN/). Currently, I'm a lecturer in School of Computer Science at Wuhan Institute of Technology. From Dec 2019 to Dec 2020, I visited at the Schulich School of Engineering Intelligent Geospatial Data Mining Lab in Department of Geomatics at University of Calgary, supervised by prof.[Xin Wang](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/xin-wang). 

Research Interest
======
Currently, I am broadly interested in data mining and machine learning.

In particular, the goal is to develop machine learning-based algorithms for categorical data analysis, e.g., distance metric and representation learning. The difficulties in categorical data analysis is, but not limited to, how to represent the complex coupling relationships, how to handle the concept shift, and how to handle the imbalance data, which bring in the consiferable challanges. We wish to develop the effective and efficient methods about structure extension, multi-view learning, dynamic ensemble learning, few-shot learning to tackle these challenges.

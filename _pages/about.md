I am a PhD (DPhil) candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford.

My research interests are in development, labour, and behavioural economics. I use randomised and natural experiments to help answer policy questions. \
My current research studies firm and household behaviour in low-income rural settings.

I am also affiliated with the [Applied Microeconomics research group](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/applied-microeconomics-0), the [Bissau Economics Lab](https://bissaueconomicslab.weebly.com/), the [Centre for the Study of African Economies](https://www.csae.ox.ac.uk/), and the [Mind and Behaviour Research Group](https://mbrg.bsg.ox.ac.uk/).

  <summary><b>Impact of Market Information on Cashew Producers in Guinea-Bissau</b><br>
  <i>with Brais Álvarez Pereira, Adewusi Mendonça, Dayvikson Raiss Laval Tavares, Sebastian Schäber</i>
</summary>
  <br>
  <p><i>Abstract:</i>  Does lack of information reduce the ability of producers to find the right time to sell their products? To answer this question, we ran a two-level cluster randomized control trial among 1988 cashew producers in 290 villages in Guinea-Bissau. Treated producers received weekly messages to their mobiles during the trading season in 2020. The messages provided up-to-date market news, farmgate prices, and gave marketing advice. We found that treated producers sold their cashews more frequently relative to the producers in other experimental groups, who tend to sell their cashews in a single transaction. Treated producers failed to earn higher prices, but earned more from all sales and barters, relative to the control group mean. We explore several mechanisms to understand our results. We find evidence that between-village spillovers can explain why we failed to detect an increase in average prices within treated villages. We found no evidence suggesting that treated producers changed their buyers, the location of their sales, had more bargaining power, better record keeping, or different attitudes towards risk. Given the low cost of our intervention, market information can be a cost-effective tool to increase producers' revenues.	</p>

  <summary><b>Labour Market Effects of Ethiopia's Social Safety Net</b></summary>
    <br>
  <p><i>Abstract:</i>  This  paper assesses how a large transfer programme combining public works and unconditional transfers to food-insecure households in rural Ethiopia affects local labour markets. Using  repeated cross-sections of the National Labour Force Survey, I show that the programme did not change employment rates or wages in this rural economy. Instead, I find that workers shifted from agricultural to non-agricultural self-employment. I complement this analysis using  data from the Ethiopian Socio-Economic surveys and find similar results.  These results are at odds with previous work due to the thinness of rural wage markets in Ethiopia.</p>

  <summary><b>The Future in Mind: Aspirations and Future-Oriented Behaviour in Rural Ethiopia</b><br>
  <i>with Tanguy Bernard, Stefan Dercon, Kate Orkin, Alemayehu Seyoum Taffesse</i></summary>
    <br>
  <p><i>Abstract:</i>  People living in deprivation may not make long term investments if they doubt that a better life is possible. In a randomised control trial in remote, rural Ethiopia, we test if changing how people perceive their future opportunities alters investment. We show a treatment group video documentaries about the lives of role models from similar communities who escaped poverty through their own efforts in agriculture or business. Five years later, treated household heads report higher labour supply, more use of agricultural inputs and increased education spending. They have accumulated more assets, their children have attained more years of schooling, and they have increased asset wealth, housing quality and food security. We provide evidence consistent with the mechanism being an increase in aspirations. We outline a simple model of household consumption and production with reference-dependent utility, in which aspirations are defined as reference points for consumption and meeting aspirations yields utility over and above the utility of consumption. In such a model, changes in reference points increase effort and investment. We also show in survey data that individuals in treated households report higher aspirations --- hopes for the level of income and assets they hope to attain --- straight after screening and after five years. Furthermore, exposure to video or outsiders and other psychological mechanisms are unlikely to account for effects: a placebo group shown a local entertainment programme are unaffected, and there are no effects of treatment on preferences, social norms and other psychological characteristics. Exploiting randomised intensity of treatment between villages, we find little evidence of aspirations or behaviour change being transmitted between households, suggesting such interventions may need to reach individuals directly.</p>

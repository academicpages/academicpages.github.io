- I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow, advised by [Prof. Daniel Lingwood](https://ragoninstitute.org/lingwood/) at [Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard](https://ragoninstitute.org/), and co-advised by [Prof. Douglas A Lauffenburger](http://web.mit.edu/dallab/people/index.html) at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/). I am also a member of the systems serology lab lead by [Dr. Ryan Mcnamara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-mcnamara-phd-084b33a2). I was advised by [Prof. Galit Alter](https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/3588853/Galit-Alter) before October 2022 (now the Vice President of Immunology Research at Moderna).
- Prior to joining the Ragon Institute, I received my Ph.D. degree in [School of Engineering](https://engineering.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), advised by [Prof. George Em Karniadakis](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/george-karniadakis) and co-advised by [Prof. Christos Mantzoros](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/christos-s-mantzoros-md-dsc-phd-hc-mult/) at BIDMC, in Feburaray 2022 (thesis defense in September 2021). I received my B.Eng. degree in [School of Naval Architecture, Ocean and Civil Engineering](https://en.naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2015.
- My current research interest is on integrating **physics-informed** and **data-driven computational models** to probe the mechanisms of diseases and effectiveness of therapeutics by leveraging data acquired from bench-side to bed-side and existing biological/medical knowledge, for example, diabetes in endocrinology and infectious diseases in immunology.
- [CV](http://yixiangd.github.io/files/YixiangDeng_CV.pdf)
- I kindly invite you to submit to our special issue on *Molecular and Cellular Biomechanics*: [Physics-informed machine learning for biomechanics and bio-fluid dynamics](https://www.techscience.com/mcb/special_detail/physics_machine-learning). Deadline is **May 31, 2024**.

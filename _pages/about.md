I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. Prior to VT, I spent a year as research scientist (Research Staff Member) at IBM Almaden Research Center, working on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing  and Information Retrieval problems. I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Computer Science Department](http://cs.illinois.edu), [University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign](http://illinois.edu), under the supervision of Prof. [ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu), [Text Information Management and Analysis Group (TIMAN)](http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir). 


My research interests lie in the intersection of Data Science, Big Data, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. My work revolves around machine learning challenges related to data, e.g., learning with limited imperfect supervision, self-supervision, uncertainty calibration, outlier detection, adversarial training, essentially work under the theme of  <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Data Quality in Machine Learning</span>. My current projects involve active and semi-supervised learning, contrastive multi-modal learning, graph adversarial learning, sequential decision making and interpretability mechanisms. Previously worked on <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Deep Learning for Social Media Analysis</span>, where I extensively collaborated on interdisciplinary projects that touch societal dimensions, in areas ranging from Health Informatics and Genomics to Psychology, Education and Social Computing. You can learn more by looking at my [publications](/publications). I am excited about opportunities to collaborate in areas such as *Reinforcement Learning*, *Multi-agent RL* and *Meta-learning*.


<!--- My main work is in the intersection of Data Science and Machine Learning, particularly improving Deep Learning models for real-world scenarios, considering all sorts of bottlenecks related to data noise, sparsity, domain shift and lack of annotations. I mainly focus on <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Active and Semi-supervised learning</span>. Previously worked on <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Deep Learning for Social Media Analysis</span>. Social media text is informal, abundant and full of linguistic variations. [TextNormSeq2Seq](https://github.com/Isminoula/TextNormSeq2Seq) is a hybrid Seq2Seq model that can serve as a pre-processing step for any NLP application to adapt to noisy social media text. I have also participated on interdisciplinary projects that touch societal problems.  You can learn more by looking at my [publications](/publications) or the descriptions of current and past [projects](/portfolio). I am excited about opportunities to collaborate in areas such as *Reinforcement Learning*, *Multi-agent RL* and *Meta-learning*.-->

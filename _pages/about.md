Hello! I am a Lecturer and Research Data Services Specialist at the [RDS](https://research.library.gsu.edu/dataservices) Department and Affiliate Faculty with the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.gsu.edu/) at Georgia State University (GSU). 

My research broadly focuses on political parties and elections, opposition cooperation and coordination, democratic backsliding, and authoritarian regimes. I am currently working on my book project which addresses the pre-electoral coalitions formed in electoral autocracies. My research on Turkish electoral coalitions received the Best Paper Award at [ISA-South](https://twitter.com/ozlem__tuncel/status/1710733972873900453) and Best Fieldwork Award – Honorable Mention from [APSA’s Democracy and Autocracy section](/files/Tuncel_APSA_Award.pdf). My research has been supported by the [William A. Steiger Fund for Legislative Studies](https://connect.apsanet.org/centennialcenter/2022/09/01/pre-electoral-opposition-coalitions-in-authoritarian-regimes/) of the APSA Centennial Grant, [Institute for Human Studies](https://www.theihs.org/), Craigie Fellowship, and [GSU Library Dissertation Award](https://graduate.gsu.edu/dissertation-library-travel-awards/). 

My research has been published in the *Party Politics*, *QMMR*, *Journal of Peace Research*, and *Journal of Civil Society*. My published and working papers can be found on my [publications page](https://ozlemtuncel.github.io/publications/) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q4RzaGMAAAAJ&hl=en). Access my most current CV [here](https://ozlemtuncel.github.io/cv/).

I received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Political Science](https://politicalscience.gsu.edu/) at GSU in Atlanta, Georgia. I received my BA and MA from [Political Science and International Relations Department at Bogazici University](https://pols.boun.edu.tr/).

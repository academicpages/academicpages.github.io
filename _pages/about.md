## Here is a brief introduction about myself.

Hello,

I'm a computer science engineer with over 10 years of experience, primarily focused on data. I'm a curious, enthusiastic, and easy-going person who is always seeking new challenges. Throughout my career, I've developed a strong attention to detail and resilience against frustration, which have helped me continuously learn and adapt in an ever-evolving field.  

Getting My First Job 📦 🎉
------
I began my career at a consulting firm in 2013, working as a developer and analyst. This role involved a variety of tasks, primarily focused on developing web applications and managing databases. I learned Java and Oracle SQL to work on projects for one of the company's main clients, Banco Falabella (a bank).It was a very demanding experience. I worked many hours each week, and I think that I learned in three years what I should have learned in six.

Changing My Developer Path 🔄 💻
------
After some time, I aspired to become part of the bank itself. I applied for a position at Banco Falabella and was successful. My new role was completely different, focusing on extracting information from databases to provide to my five commercial coworkers, enabling them to update and send reports to various departments. This transition required me to shift my computer science skills from working with developers to collaborating with commercial teams. Adapting my communication style greatly helped me develop a business-oriented vision and realize that everything I worked on had a purpose beyond just coding.

My main tasks included maintaining and creating new database processes to deliver data to my coworkers, who then generated reports in Excel. As a computer scientist, this was crazy for me. However, it was during this time that data visualization tools emerged in my career. I began creating Power BI dashboards on my own and demonstrated to my supervisors how effective and easy it was to create and share dashboards. Although I was still new and didn't fully understand how to implement changes in a large company, my persistence paid off. This successful year led me to a new position in the business intelligence area.

Business Intelligence 📊 🧠
------
I transitioned to the business intelligence department, specifically within the Data Visualization team. Here, we created dashboards for various commercial teams, including credit cards, debit cards, credit, mortgages, and more. During this period, I gained valuable experience in managing commercial requirements and understanding available data, what was possible to achieve, and what might require additional effort.

Sometimes, creating a sales dashboard was straightforward because the data was readily available. Other times, it was challenging to acquire new data or create processes to pull CSV files from different departments to add new columns to the dashboard. At this stage, everything was handled using Oracle and SPSS Modeler as an ETL tool.

The positive aspect was that the bank aimed to become a data-driven decision-making company, so they migrated everything to Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This transition allowed me to see the magic of updating 100 million rows in one minute instead of 40 minutes. The bank created a new division called "Data Factory," with a regional focus on Chile, Peru, and Colombia, and the data visualization area was moved there.

Regional Data Visualization Role 🌍 📈 
------
In this role, the department's goals shifted. We began working with both Tableau and Power BI, each serving different purposes. Power BI was used for older, more static reports, while Tableau was the new tool promoted by the department. The main idea was to enable self-service for the various commercial departments. Our primary tasks were to teach them how to use Tableau and administer the Tableau server, ensuring that data sources were updated with the necessary data.

With this new approach, we focused on creating new BigQuery database processes to make data available for them to explore and perform their own analyses.

Pause in My Career ⏸️ 📅
------
After COVID-19, I felt a bit stagnant in my role and wanted to learn new skills, my lack of English made it difficutl. I decided to leave my job and traveled to Ireland to improve my English. I spent almost a year attending English classes and seeking new opportunities for growth. During this time, I realized the explosive growth in the field of AI and wanted to be a part of it. I began working as a freelancer while simultaneously studying machine learning, deep learning, and Generative AI. Over the past year, I've earned certificates, created my own projects, and worked towards securing a position in the AI field, I felt enchanted once again by my career.

Freelancer 🧑‍💻 🌟
------
Over the past year, I've worked on various projects, one of which has lasted over eight months, primarily in the data visualization field. Thanks to my intensive Python training, my main approach has been to read, organize, and load data using Python before creating visualizations in Tableau, Power BI, or Looker Studio, depending on the client's needs and environment. Most of the time, I've worked with Google tools, but I also have experience with Microsoft Fabric.

**Thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to contributing my skills and passion to new challenges in the data and AI fields!**

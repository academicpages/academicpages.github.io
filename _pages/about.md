<!-- # About me [[My CV_CN](https://github.com/Luoxd1996/Luoxd1996.github.io/blob/master/files/xiangdeluo_cv.pdf)] -->
# About me
* I am a 4th-year PhD student in the School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), co-advised by Prof. [Guotai Wang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Z2sFN4EAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Shaoting Zhang](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=oiBMWK4AAAAJ&hl=en). 
* My research mainly focuses on medical image analysis, particularly in data-efficient learning for medical image computing, such as semi-supervised learning, weakly-supervised learning and human-in-the-loop, and extending them for practical clinical applications.
* I received my Bachelor's Degree in the School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) on July 1, 2018.
* <font color="red">I am looking for collaborators on AI for oncology radiotherapy (OARs, GTV and CTV delineation; prognosis prediction, etc.). We have collected several large-scale datasets to develop AI models and research benchmarks (more than 3000 patients with ~ 80 organ/tissue/tumor and clinical informations from multi-center have been collected and annotated manually). If you have any interest, please feel free to contact me.</font>
<!--* Now, I am seeking for a research internship position about medical image segmentation during 2021.06-2021.10, feel free to contact me! [[My CV](https://github.com/Luoxd1996/Luoxd1996.github.io/blob/master/files/xiangdeluo_cv.pdf)]-->

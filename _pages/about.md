I am a Ph.D. Student and Graduate Research Assistant at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering, [Villanova University](https://www1.villanova.edu/university.html), PA, USA. I am the menber of the [Villanova Human Mobility Data Lab (NovaMobility)](https://cfxiong.github.io/data-lab/) supervised by [Dr. Chenfeng Xiong](https://cfxiong.github.io/). I am passionate about everything related to transportation and various advanced applications that are technology-oriented. I care about cutting-edge technological applications in transportation, such as map matching for human travel trajectories and lane detection in autonomous driving. I also focus on the environmental impact of transportation, such as the effect of vehicle-generated air pollutants on road areas. Currently, I am mainly involved in the generation and processing of human mobility data, with a primary focus on the application of map matching technology in human mobility data. I am passionate about applying the latest technologies, such as machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and various software and tools, to address transportation issues.

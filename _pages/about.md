<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">I am actively looking for a research scientist intern role.</span>


I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/person/hafez-ghaemi/) and [Université de Montréal](https://diro.umontreal.ca/english/home/). My primary research focus is on predictive architectures for self-supervised learning. Particularly, I am interested in building self-supervised world models that can be leveraged in perception and planning in different modalities. I am advised by [Eilif Muller](https://scholar.google.ch/citations?user=r4-NZhwAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Shahab Bakhtiari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f_JDOhEAAAAJ&hl=en).


Previously, I completed my second M.Sc. in computer engineering at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en) (advised by [Hamed Kebriaei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eDseLNYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Majid Nili](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QlwWxmoAAAAJ&hl=en)). I hold another M.Sc. in data science and engineering from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/en?lang=en) (advised by [Fabio Fagnani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oqwlDQEAAAAJ) and [Giacomo Como](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7dju3QoAAAAJ&hl=en)). I completed my B.Sc. in mechanical engineering with a minor in computer engineering at University of Tehran (advised by [Masoud Shariat Panahi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UwlyBw0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)).

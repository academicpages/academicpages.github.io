I am a second year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania working in the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision under the supervision of Professor Chris Callison-Burch and Professor Mark Yatskar. 

My interest lies in the study of knowledge and its acquisition, encoding, and communication. I recognize that knowledge encompasses more than just language - especially for procedural information - and therefore my research explores the importance of multimodality in knowledge encoding and transmission. I examine the impact of sensory inputs and mental experiences on our understanding of the world. My higher-arching goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between knowledge, perception, and communication and how they can be utilized for a comprehensive view of the world. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a strong passion for education. As a Teaching Assistant at the University of Pennsylvania, and through my community teaching experiences, I have acquired a teaching style that prioritizes creating a comfortable and inclusive environment for learning. I strive to challenge students with the beautiful and mentally stimulating concepts of mathematics, logic, and computer science, while also breaking down any mental barriers that may have been created from past negative experiences.

<b>I firmly believe that computer science is a field for everyone, regardless of their background, and it is especially crucial in this day and age</b>.

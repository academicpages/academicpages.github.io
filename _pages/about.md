I work as a data scientist, manager, and strategist at the [MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT)](https://moht.com.sg) in Singapore, where I work on a portfolio of projects at the intersection of AI and mental health.

I completed my PhD in the [Adaptive Brain Lab](https://www.abg.psychol.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge's Department of Psychology, under the supervision of [Zoe Kourtzi](https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/staff/professor-zoe-kourtzi) and [Mark van der Wilk](https://mvdw.uk).
Here, I worked on AI for Brain Science and Mental Health and computational cognitive neuroscience approaches to learning and decision making.

Previously, I helped establish a machine learning team at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.

During my MPhil, supervised by [Pascale Fung](http://www.ee.ust.hk/~pascale/), I worked on several projects related to affective computing.
I also worked with [Genta Indra Winata](https://gentaiscool.github.io/) on a virtual therapist self-help platform.
We modelled user affect state with deep learning methods to construct emotionally intelligent dialogue.

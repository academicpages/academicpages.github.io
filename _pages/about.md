Welcome ! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Paris-Saclay within [CIRED](http://www.centre-cired.fr/en/) and [PSAE](https://www6.versailles-grignon.inrae.fr/psae_eng/) research units. Here is my [CV](https://RomainFillon.github.io/files/CV_academique.pdf).

From September 2023 to January 2024, I will be visiting Columbia University (New York, USA), hosted by Gernot Wagner and financed by a Fulbright grant.

I work on climate change and I am particularly interested in climate tipping points and social preferences under risk and uncertainty. I also work with quantitative spatial models. 

Feel free to contact me : rfillon@protonmail.com !

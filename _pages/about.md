I am an Assistant Teaching Professor at Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Sciences. I received my PhD at the University of Utah Kahlert School of Computing. My research background is in computational models of narratives and computer-assisted storytelling. 

Teaching
======
I am passionate about teaching and I am working on ways to support this space in two ways.
1. I'm engaged in mentoring stuents who want to pursue being an educator in Computer and Data Sciences. I started teaching during my undergraduate years, and if you're an undergraduate or graduate student interested in teaching opportunities, feel free to reach out. 
2. I believe in broadening participation in computing through interdisciplinary work. In my beginner courses, I share stories and inspire students to reflect on their interests and majors and find ways to use computing to solve interesting problems in those areas. I believe in using computational approaches to solve problems you are passionate about! Which brings me to...

Science for Stories
======
My research focuses on the intersection of computer science with storytelling, digital entertainment, and cognitive psychology. I strive to advance technologies to help people create stories. My research has considered narrative understanding, assisted authoring for scriptwriters, and computational plot generation. My dissertation focused on generation of plots where characters can potentially attempt (and fail at) actions due to their incorrect beliefs about the world.

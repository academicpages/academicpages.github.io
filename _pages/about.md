excerpt: What is the use of having developed a science well enough to make predictions if, in the end, all we are willing to do is stand around and wait for them to come true? Not even mention that science is to be suspected but not to be believed

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at [School of GeoSciences](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences), [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I hold a PhD in Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, completed in less than 3 years at The University of Edinburgh. My PhD, entitled “Impacts of aerosols on air quality, climate and extremes”, was supervised by Prof [David Stevenson](https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/dstevens) and Dr [Massimo Bollasina](https://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/people/person.html?indv=3627&ri=1). My PhD project has unravelled important mechanisms through which aerosol changes influence climate and extremes, and has been widely covered by media including [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/20/tackling-air-pollution-heatwaves-longer-more-likely-study) and [BBC News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-48174218?SThisFB&fbclid=IwAR320ixWy7ToyJ2-c30I_gukpTo_2uw-Cps5XVNmsHLr-nCoTgER2PSz120). Previously, I recieved my MSc and BSc in Oceanography (2014-2016) and Satellite Ocean Remote Sensing (2010-2014), respectively, from the prestigeous [Ocean University of China](http://eweb.ouc.edu.cn/).

I am a contributing author to the [IPCC AR6](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-cycle/) on atmospheric methane and oxidising capability, serving as a lead author of the [AerChemMIP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TKGX-Y7dGYr1U4ezsWYA9V8XmzHsSsNhNQ39ZVjPI4E/edit) joint analysis. My current research focuses on short-lived climate forcers, their impacts on radiative forcing and climate, using a variety of tools, ranging from observations and reanalysis to numerical modelling.

You can also find me from the [University Page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/people/person.html?indv=5072), [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alcide_Zhao) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=-H85oHsAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am a postdoc at IBM Research where I work in the [Center for Computational Health](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=6743) and [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu). My research is in applied machine learning for healthcare. Before joining IBM, I was a PhD student at MIT where I worked in the [Braatz](http://web.mit.edu/braatzgroup/) lab.

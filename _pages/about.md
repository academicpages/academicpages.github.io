Under Construction!!!&#128679;

* I will update this website by late August&#128583;.

Hi there! I'm a research student in [the Department of Mathematical and Computing Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/is/eng/) at the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04) in Japan (*Please note that the university will be renamed [the Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en) on October 1, 2024). Before joining Tokyo Tech, I majored in History and Philosophy of Science and minored in Computer Science at [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/). I'm applying to graduate programs in computer science for the 2025 cycle. Here is my CV (This is an [old version](http://yudaiurabe.github.io/files/20250311_YudaiUrabe_CV.pdf). I will upload a new one soon!).\\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am currently interested in Programming Languages (PL), especially static analysis, and in applying PL theories and techniques to other domains such as natural language. My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between programming languages and natural languages - to __formally__ translate natural languages into functional programming languages while preserving meaning. I believe this will reduce errors in programs and lead to more secure and reliable systems in the long run.

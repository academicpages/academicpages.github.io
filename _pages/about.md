The release of Satoshi's Bitcoin paper marked the beginning of a silent revolution. Bitcoin, the first generation of blockchain, was designed solely for payments. Ethereum expanded this concept by introducing Turing-complete on-chain programs, leading to the birth of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). As DeFi gained traction, it became a killer app for blockchains. Scalability remained a significant challenge. Prominent blockchains like Solana, Aptos, Sui, and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and appchain ecosystems like Cosmos and Polkadot began to emerge. We are now in the third generation of blockchains, where scalability is reasonably managed. However, the main challenge remains the widespread adoption and onboarding of individuals and institutions.

Supra
=====

Joshua Tobkin, CEO of Supra, envisaged long ago that to gain wider adoption to the masses it is critical to provide all blockchain services on one single platform. This trend is now clearly evident. We may now call this the fourth generation of blockchains. But to pierce through the dense and opaque clouds of thinking at the time when the only main problem builders narrowly focussed on was scalabilty, was a pure piece of visionary thinking.

Impressed and enthused by his vision, many and I joined his jet to build Supra, a fourth generation blockchain.

Industrial Research
===================
Thriving Academic Research is the sign that the scientific spirit in man is still alive and kicking. It is the engine that propels our minds towards new horizons. New vistas open to the minds eye. Engineering pins down these novel ideas, builds concrete edifices, and realizes the great truths in our common living. Enterpreneurship / Industry is the enabler of this bridge. Technology Transfer from Research to Production is the main focus of an Industry R & D. It is as much of a science as much of an art. I am a long-term and a continuous student of this art.

Passionate about leading R&D teams from the ideation to the full product. 

All areas of scientific endeavour enthuses me. Keen to do research in all streams related to Blockchain technology. Specifically, the areas of distributed systems and protocols design, programming languages program analysis, cyber security, formal methods are the most familiar to me.

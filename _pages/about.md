I'm a Ph.D. candidate studying machine learning at Duke University under Prof. [Maciej Mazurowski](https://sites.duke.edu/mazurowski/). My current research is in deep learning for medical image analysis; specifically domain adaptation, image-to-image translation and image generation, and related topics. Broadly, I'm also interested in how foundational machine learning concepts, such as [generalization, intrinsic geometric dataset properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08865), and image distribution distance metrics behave differently or should be adapted in the context of medical image analysis.

Additionally, I'm drawn to the intersection of ML and science: understanding deep learning from a scientific perspective, and the use of DL for scientific modeling & discovery and science-adjacent fields.

I have also worked as a research intern in the Math, Stats, and Data Science Group at [PNNL](https://www.pnnl.gov/). My undergrad was at UNC in physics and math, with research in statistical techniques for astronomy.

See my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=a9rXidMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) for a full list of my publications, with select papers highlighted in the section below.

On my free time I like to practice jiu-jitsu and yoga, cook, listen to and play music, and read.

I am a Ph.D. student in [Political Science at Georgia State University](https://politicalscience.gsu.edu/) in Atlanta, Georgia. My research agenda focuses on political parties and competitive authoritarian regimes. My dissertation project focuses on pre-electoral coalitions formed in competitive autocratic regimes. 

I am currently co-chair of Atlanta Symposium on Political Science (ASOPS). I received my BA and MA from [Political Science and International Relations Department at Bogazici University](https://pols.boun.edu.tr/). My MA thesis focused on the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the role of civil society in educational policymaking in Turkey. 

In my free time I like to hike, cook, read, and play tabletop games.

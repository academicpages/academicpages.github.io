# Hi there! 👋

I am an aspiring researcher in the field of Guidance, Control, and Navigations. Specifically, my interest is to be involved in space technology and its applications. Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant at the University of Trento in the [Simulation and Virtual Reality Lab](https://www.dii.unitn.it/en/401/simulators-and-virtual-reality). 

I also co-founded a private research group that aims at solving problems in the field of [Space dynamcis control and system engineering](https://sdcsgroup.mobirisesite.com/home.html). 

Previously, I worked as a software developer in rapid prototyping of advanced driver assistance systems at the Center for research, FIAT (present Stellantis) and as a R & D System validation engineer at Electrolux.

Outside work, I love watching Test match cricket and movies, playing table tennis. Currently trying my luck with Snowboarding in the Alpine mountains.


## My research style:
- My personal preference is to involve myself in a research style that balances mathematical rigor and engineering applications. 
- I am a strong believer of collobaration and teamwork. I actively participate in discussing the progress or research questions i have with my colleagues and look towards understanding their perspective.

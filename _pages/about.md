I am a research mathematician working as a postdoctoral research fellow at the university of Southern Denmark, Odense. I obtained my PhD from The Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim in 2021 under the supervision of [Professor Franz Luef](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/franz.luef) and [Professor Eduard Ortega](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/eduard.ortega).

My research interests lie in the intersection between operator algebras and groups and groupoids. I currently focus on ideal intersection properties of convolution algebras associated with groups and groupoids. Recently I have also done research on compact quantum metric spaces.

I co-organize the [SDU Operator Algebras Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/operator-algebras-sdu).

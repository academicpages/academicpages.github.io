I have strong research interests in labor economics and economics of innovation. My dissertation examines information frictions about workers in various labor markets, using novel datasets, causal inference and structural methods to quantify the impact of employer learning on labor market mobility, wages and aggregate productivity. In my job market paper, I study asymmetric employer learning in the labor market for computer scientists. 

Here is a link to my [CV](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator).

I am Haotian Zhang, a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Before joining the CUHK, I obtained a Bachelor degree in economics (with a minor in finance) at the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (SWUFE) and a _first class_ Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in the Mathematical Economics and Statistics at the University of Birmingham.

I am interested in developing econometrics tools for analysing the high-frequency financial data and empirical studies for the market microstructure.

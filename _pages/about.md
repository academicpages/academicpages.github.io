## Hi 👋! I'm Ashley! 

I am a lab manager at Dr. Maital Neta's [Cognitive Affective Neuroscience lab](https://psychology.unl.edu/can-lab/) at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. 
* I got my BSA in Neuroscience with an Evidence and Inquiry certificate from the University of Texas at Austin.
* I completed a thesis that investigated the effect of social rejection on memory processes, supervised by [Dr. Alison Preston](https://clm.utexas.edu/preston/) and [Dr. Jennifer Beer](https://sites.google.com/site/utselfregulationlab/welcome-to-dr-jennifer-beers-self-regulation-lab-at-the-university-of-texas-at-austin).
* At UT, I was also an undergraduate teaching assistant for three years in four different courses. 

My research interests lie in social connection, emotion perception and regulation, interpersonal and intergroup conflict, and applying psychological interventions to solve real-life issues. I am especially passionate about using new statistical and computational methods to investigate these interests 🤖, open science 🥼, and sharing knowledge 👩🏼‍🏫.

You can find more information about my [research](research.md), or my [CV](CV.md) on this website.

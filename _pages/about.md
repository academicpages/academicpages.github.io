I'm Saket Pradhan—a software developer, chess player, and robotics enthusiast. I build applications on computer vision and real-time ML. I'm a student at the University of Michigan, pursuing my Master's in Robotics, with a keen interest in vision-guided mobility systems. 

I've recently worked at [invideo](https://invideo.io), an online video creation platform, leveraging AI to help users create professional videos for marketing, promotions, and more. Previously, I interned with the [JSW Group](https://www.jsw.in/) and [Nucsoft](https://www.nucsoft.com/). 

During my free time, I like to travel, play chess, and study linguistics/language history (the growth and evolution of world languages). I'm an avid Formula Racing fan and was involved in Formula Student projects during my undergrad days.

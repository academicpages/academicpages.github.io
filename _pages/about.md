I am a third year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Warwick supervised by [Prof Theo Damoulas](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/damoulas/) and [Dr Ramanujan Sridharan](https://msramanujan.weebly.com/). I am an active member of the [Warwick Machine Learning Group](https://wmlg.io/).

My research interests lie in the intersection of distributionally robust optimisation, graph theory, and machine learning.

From Oct 2022 - Mar 2023 I was an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon supervised by [Phillip Loick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-loick-9333b6173/?originalSubdomain=lu).

Prior to starting my PhD, I was a research assistant working at The Alan Turing Institute (2019-2020) and the University of Warwick (2018-2019). Projects I was working on include the London Air Quality Project and Project Odysseus. From 2015-2018, I completed my BSc in Computer Science at the University of Warwick.

## Hi there 👋

I work at [Big Data Architecture Department of Bilibili, Real-time Computing Team](https://ir.bilibili.com/) as a Software Development Engineer now in Shanghai, working for cloud computing, real-time computing, unified streaming and batch processing, and storage-compute separation.

I graduated from [School of Mathematics](https://www.math.sdu.edu.cn/), Shandong University (山东大学数学学院) with a bachelor's degree advised by [Yuming Xv (许玉铭)](https://www.math.sdu.edu.cn/info/1084/3603.htm). I also collaborate with Yun Jiang (蒋云), Ye Qie (邱耶), and Mengqiao Sun(孙梦桥) from  [Zhejiang Peking University Advanced Institute of Information Technology](https://www.aiit.org.cn/) closely. 

### 🔥 Academic Work in Progress

I am currently researching the integration of real-time and batch processing, Serverless Computing, as well as cloud-native computing construction at the Big Data Architecture Department of Bilibili Inc. in Shanghai, China. My work involves optimizing computing engines and algorithms to achieve efficient resource consumption in large-scale computing clusters. My recent focus is on optimizing Flink's capabilities of real-time and batch processing and designing an intelligent cross-architecture batch task migration management system.

{% include base_path %}

I am an undergraduate at UCSD with hopes to pursue a role in SWE. I am double majoring in Math-Computer Science and Cognitive Science and enjoy auditing classes in philosophy.

I am currently looking for a 2022 internship positions as a software engineer. Please check my [resume](https://godsped.com/cv) for links to my past experiences.
## About

I am interested in investigating the applications machine learning techniques and its intersection with various fields, particularly NLP. I see computers' knowledge of human language as the next big interface for humans to utilize computing power more naturally. I look forward to the day computers gain a semantic understanding of language. 
I am also passionate about the application of simulation in developing robust systems. I am currently looking into using Unity simulations to accelerate software development on aerial vehicles. Simulations can be integrated into automated testing pipelines and used for human sanity-check verification during rapid development cycles. 
## About Me

👋 Hey, I'm Samir, but you can call me Samir.

My recent covid hobby has been an Among Us addiction. I also have been going through my backlog of things I've been meaning to do (like giving this site a little love 🫀). I am currently working on developing a fun little platforming game in with my friends. If you have any recommendations, I enjoy discovering new music and seeing all the interesting genres people come up with.

I'd love to talk about anything! Feel free to suggest a time that works [here](https://calendly.com/samir0/30min) 🕰.

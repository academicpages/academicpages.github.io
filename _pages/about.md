I'm a PhD student in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) at the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://web.mit.edu/). I currently work in the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) in the [Computation and Biology](http://people.csail.mit.edu/bab/) group, where my research broadly focuses on designing computational methods to address challenges in biology and human health. I'm currently working on methods for predicting protein interactions from amino acid sequence.

Previously, I was a member of the [Computational Biology Research Lab](https://compbio.engr.uconn.edu/) at the [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/), where my research focused on [phylogenetic methods for understanding infectious disease](https://compbio.engr.uconn.edu/software/treefix-tp/).

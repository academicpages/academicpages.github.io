My name is Z. Sun, a 3rd year PhD student at UCL and The Alan Turing Institute. I am lucky to be supervised by Prof. [F-X Briol](https://fxbriol.github.io) and Prof. [J-H Xue](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucakjxu/). My research is funded by EPSRC and UCL jointly. 





## Research Interest
In general, I am very interested in __computational statistics__ and __machine learning__. I am also very interested in applications of statistics and machine learning.


## Academic Activities
   * This year, I am an [Enrichment student](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/turing-welcomes-next-generation-data-enthusiasts-academic-institutions-across-uk) at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk).
   *  Organiser of 2022 [Statistics in Data-Centric Engineering (S-DCE)](https://sites.google.com/view/dce-reading-group) Seminars at The Alan Turing Institute.

- I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow, advised by [Prof. Daniel Lingwood](https://ragoninstitute.org/lingwood/) at [Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard](https://ragoninstitute.org/), and co-advised by [Prof. Douglas A Lauffenburger](http://web.mit.edu/dallab/people/index.html) at MIT. I am also a member of the systems serology lab lead by [Dr. Ryan Mcnamara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-mcnamara-phd-084b33a2). I was advised by [Prof. Galit Alter](https://ragoninstitute.org/alter/) currently on leave for Moderna before October 2022.
- Prior to joining the Ragon Institute, I received my Ph.D. in [School of Engineering](https://engineering.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), working with [Prof. George Em Karniadakis](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/george-karniadakis), in September 2021. I received my B.Eng. degree in [School of Naval Architecture, Ocean and Civil Engineering](https://en.naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2015.
- My current research interest is on computational bioinformatics for infectious diseases. My broad research interests focus on biomechanical and bioinformatic modeling in diabetes and infectious diseases.

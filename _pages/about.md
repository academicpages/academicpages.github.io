I use numerical methods to understand geodynamic processes within the solid Earth across different temporal and spatial scales. I have built subduction frameworks to understand the tectonic and rheological origin of extensional structures, e.g., rifting, opening, and spreading seafloor, developed within the overriding plate. These numerical models (presented in the '[Research](https://zhibinlei.github.io/research/)' page) investigate - but are not restricted to - the role of high trench retreat rate, multiple slab subduction (dual inward dipping subduction), and inherited lateral lithospheric heterogeneities, in governing the strain localisation (plate weakening processes) that occur within the overriding plate during subduction. A synoptic summary of these findings can be found in my [PhD thesis](https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/id/eprint/152759/1/2022leizphd.pdf) (Figure 6.2).

Research interests
--
As introduced in the '[Research](https://zhibinlei.github.io/research/)' page, I have built some thermal-mechanical subduction frameworks. In the long run, I am interested in incorporating melting, and its role in creating magmatism in the mantle wedge, altering the rheology during migration, promoting magma intrusion upwards into the overlying lithosphere. Besides, I am also interested in investigating the driving mechanism of intraplate volcanism, especially in the NE Asia.

In my research, I enjoy working across disciplines: linking rheological, geochemical, geophysical, and geological processes with geodynamic models; as well as carrying insights into their impact on climate change, mineralization, outbreak of geohazards and transformation of ecosystem. Most of my research is hypothesis driven, often combining collaboration with researchers from other disciplines. Any discussion on the research output and potential collaboration are welcome via [email](mailto:leiz2@cardiff.ac.uk).

I am a <b>Senior Researcher</b> at the [INVEST Research Flagship Center](https://invest.utu.fi) of the University of Turku, Finland. I also serve as the <b>Research Director</b> of the [INVEST-Hub](https://www.utu.fi/en/investhub) about experimental research and interventions, as an <b>Adjunct Researcher</b> at the [Foundational Research on Data](https://imfd.cl/en/investigador/hector-bahamonde/), Chile, and as an <b>Associate Editor</b> of the [*Social Science*](https://www.springer.com/journal/43545/) journal (Springer)

<p class="lead"> Before joining University of Turku, I was an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) at Universidad de O'Higgins (Chile). Previously, I had served one year as a post-doctoral fellow at Tulane University (New Orleans, LA, U.S.). I received my PhD in Political Science from Rutgers University (New Brunswick, NJ, U.S.) in the spring of 2017.</p>

<p class="lead">My primary subfield is the political economy of <b>inequality</b>,  <b>political development</b> and <b>clientelism</b>. As an applied methodologist I also have a strong interest in statistical as well as experimental methods (lab and survey-based).</p>

<p class="lead"> My research is either forthcoming, or has been published in Electoral Studies, the European Journal of Political Economy, Acta Politica, Journal of Politics in Latin America, Regional Science, Policy and Practice and Revista de Ciencia Politica.

Dissertation
============

My dissertation argues that sectoral economic conflicts fostered state-building in Latin America. Using fine-grained historical case study comparisons, sectoral outputs from 1900 to the present, panel data and time-series econometric techniques, and a novel earthquake dataset (to measure state capacities), I find that industrial expansion altered the post-colonial political balance, putting heavy pressures for the implementation of tax institutions. In turn, fiscal expansion fostered both political development and economic growth. In my <b>book project</b> I expand these findings.

  Welcome to Mr. Zeping Yang’s academic webpage! This page is established to document my academic journey, where I share my academic experiences, skills and achievements. You can also have a quick access to knowing me. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in the [Institute of Reproductive and Child Health](https://irch.pku.edu.cn/), [School of Public Health](https://sph.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), China. During my Master’s program, I received comprehensive training in multiple disciplines, including Epidemiology, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Reproductive Health. I will graduate next year and am actively seeking opportunities for a Ph.D. position in related fields.

I have broad interests in understanding the intricate relationships and mechanisms through which environmental and metabolic exposures influence reproductive health outcomes. My research work has resulted in 4 publications in high-impact journals, including a first-author paper currently under review at *PLOS Medicine* (IF = 10.5). Recently, I have focused on applying interdisciplinary approaches, such as machine learning and GIS, to investigate the associations between air pollution—particularly PM2.5 and its chemical components—and common adverse pregnancy outcomes.

**Earlier age at menopause, plasma metabolome, and risk of premature mortality: A cohort study in the UK Biobank**
**Zeping Yang**, Ninghao Huang, ... Nan Li<sup>*</sup>.

- **Question** What is the metabolomic signature associated with the age at menopause, and does it mediate the relationship between earlier age at menopause and increased risk of premature mortality?
- **Findings** In this prospective cohort study of 33,687 participants, earlier menopause was significantly linked to a 60% higher risk of premature mortality for those experiencing menopause before 40 years old. A metabolomic signature of 106 metabolites correlated with premature mortality mediated 13.6% (1.9%–28.3%) of this association.
- **Meaning** An identified metabolomic signature may potentially predict and manage premature mortality risks associated with early menopause.

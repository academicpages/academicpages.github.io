I'm a Ph.D. student at the AI Graduate School of Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST). As a member of the Data Science Lab, under the guidance of [Professor Sundong Kim](http://www.sundong.kim), I am dedicated to developing AI that mimics human problem-solving and decision-making abilities by tackling puzzles that are considered challenging for existing AI technologies to solve. Our lab frequently explores diverse perspectives, and I am particularly interested in neuro-symbolic and evolutionary methods. By targeting to achieve system-2 reasoning, I try to solve tasks like Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) with my own creative problem-solving methods derived from human cognition. Currently, it might seem like too specific research, but I believe that it would become a starting point to develop more human-like AI. Please, feel free to look around my page and contact me if you have any questions!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics and a Stone Scholar at Harvard, with research interests in **labor economics** and **economics of innovation**. My current works examine information frictions about workers in various labor markets, using novel datasets, causal inference, and structural methods to quantify the impact of employer learning on labor market mobility, wages, and aggregate productivity. 

In my job market paper, I study asymmetric employer learning in the labor market for computer scientists. I build a dynamic framework to consider firms' endogenous investment in learning under monopsonistic competition, exploit differential timing of innovation disclosure to test for asymmetric employer learning, and quantify the value of learning on job mobility and productivity via structural estimation.

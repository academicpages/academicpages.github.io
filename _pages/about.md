## Hi, I'm Ethan Gates

I currently work as the Moving Image Archiving and Preservation Technician for the Department of Cinema Studies at New York University. What that means is, I'm responsible for maintenance and use of the lab spaces and equipment employed by the Cinema Studies department's two-year Master's degree program in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (of which I am also a graduate - class of 2015). I make sure our students have hands-on access and training on both legacy audiovisual equipment and the latest in media preservation technology.

More broadly, I am passionate about professional and community education around audiovisual tech. I like to learn _how_ tech works - whether that means taking apart a Betacam deck or tinkering in a command line interface - and share what I've found out with others. That's come to mean leading workshops, writing blog posts, volunteering with community archiving efforts like [XFR Collective](https://xfrcollective.wordpress.com), and a whole lot of networking with some cool people across the globe.

My undergraduate background at Amherst College ('12) was in film studies and Russian language/literature, which will hopefully explain the errant Soviet cinema references you may encounter. I still like to indulge my scholarly bent - I've occasionally published film reviews and am still actively pursuing research related to my Master's thesis on the early history of film preservation in the Soviet Union.

Please feel free to peruse my [full CV](/cv/), look over some of my [workshop materials](/workshops/), [talks](/talks/), and [published articles](/publications/), or check out my [blog](/year-archive/). Thanks for visiting, and get in touch any time!

Hello, I am Grant Wilkins. I love playing guitar, watching movies, reading, cooking, and doing some yoga/HIIT! 

When I am not doing those, I am a student at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/). There I [research green high-performance computing](https://jonccal.people.clemson.edu/), [teach/mentor](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ge/about-us/UTA.html), and [put on cool traditions](https://alumni.clemson.edu/get-involved/groups/student-alumni-association/#tab-id-2). 

In general I am environmentally concerned, but excited about the transition to renewable (and smart) grids/energy.

Feel free to explore and/or reach out!

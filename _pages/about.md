I'm a Computer Science student at the University College London. 

## My interests

I'm interested in natural language processing, text generation and image recognition. I have experience working on large-scale computer clusters, supercomputers in Europe (Okeanos, Rysy, Topola), Asia (NSCC supercomputing resources), North America (Moniuszko) and in the cloud (Microsoft Azure). 


## My professional experience

I have gained my first experience in software engineering at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modeling of the University of Warsaw. I worked on optimizations to linear algebra algorithms by implementing their parallel versions using C++/MPI and utilizing a state-of-the-art system-on-chip (SoC) programmable network engine made by Mellanox Technologies. At ICM UW, I have also worked on a web application project in Django, Bootstrap. 

At Calmsie, I have built the backend API, frontend and iOS mobile app prototypes codebase. I have administered and maintained a CentOS server where I deployed the application. I have configured Amazon S3, SES services for Calmsie.

I’m currently a Master student at Zhejiang University (ZJU) working to find out design methodology for emerging memory systems(eDRAM, NVM in 2.5D/3D packaging) and software/hardware co-design under the supervision of Professor Erping Li in <a href="http://eiei-zju.org/en/index.php">EIEI center</a>.

During ZJU, I was the group leader of RRAM-eDRAM hybrid CiM design program. In my role, I focus on the algorithm development(SNN based vision models) and optimization; the system level spec design, partly of the digital parts of the system and deal with the key features heterogenous integration of CiM. From the algorithm part, I also focus on some new machine learning aspects: Multimodal learning in SNN, hybrid DNN-HDC, etc. I used to intern to <a href="https://vlsi.rice.edu/">SIMS Lab</a> led by Prof.Kaiyuan Yang to work on the design of charge domain CiM in 2022 summer and <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/NanoX/">NanoX Lab</a> led by Prof.Haitong Li to work on the design of Hyperdimensional computing in 2023 summer.

Before ZJU, I received my B.S. from the Department of Optics and Electronic Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. During my time there, I worked on a variety of projects in the fields of silicon photonics, Machine Learning and inverse optimization. I spent a semester as a research assistant at Chen Lin's Lab, where I worked on a project to design achromatic metalenses.

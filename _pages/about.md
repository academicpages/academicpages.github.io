I'm Leonardo Pacciani-Mori /leo&#39;nardo pa&#39;tʃːani &#39;mɔːri/, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Hwa lab](https://matisse.ucsd.edu/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> at the University of California, San Diego.

I am a statistical physicist by training but I work at the interface of biological physics, microbial ecology and bacterial physiology. In particular, I study the constraints imposed by proteome allocation that bacteria have to satisfy in order to grow, and the effects that they have on population dynamics and the ecology of microbial communities.

<!--### Random fun facts
* My current [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 3

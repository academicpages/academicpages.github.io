How's one to know

I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones

In a faith forgotten land

In from the snow

Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow

Tarnished but so grand

And the old widow goes to the stone every day

But I don't I just sit here and wait

Grieving for the living

Oh goddamn

My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand

Taking mine but it's been promised to another

Oh I can't

Stop you putting roots in my dreamland

My house of stone your ivy grows

And now I'm covered in you

I wish to know

The fatal flaw that makes you long to be

Magnificently cursed

He's in the room

Your opal eyes are all I wish to see

He wants what's only yours

Oh goddamn

My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand

Taking mine but it's been promised to another

Oh I can't

Stop you putting roots in my dreamland

My house of stone your ivy grows

And now I'm covered

Clover blooms in the fields

Spring breaks loose the time is near

But what would he do if he found us out

Crescent moon coast is clear

Spring breaks loose but so does fear

He's gonna burn this house to the ground

How's one to know

I'd live and die for moments that we stole

On begged and borrowed time

So tell me to run

Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become

And drink my husband's wine

Oh goddamn

My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand

Taking mine but it's been promised to another

Oh I can't

Stop you putting roots in my dreamland

My house of stone your ivy grows

And now I'm covered in you

And I'm covered in you

So yeah it's a fire

It's a goddamn blaze in the dark

And you started it

You started it

So yeah it's a war

It's the goddamn fight of my life

And you started it

You started it

Oh I can't

Stop you putting roots in my dreamland

My house of stone your ivy grows

And now I'm covered in you

In you

Now I'm covered in you

In you

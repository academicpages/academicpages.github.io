<div style="text-align: justify;"><br>

<br>Welcome to my website !<br>

<br>I currently work as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Harris School of Public Policy at <a href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/arduino-tomasi">The University of Chicago</a>. I earned my PhD in Political Science from The London School of Economics and Political Science in 2021.<br>

<br>In my research, I use game-theoretic models to dig deeper into how public policies shape electoral outcomes and how political frictions create economic distortions in developing countries.<br>

<br>I've earned both an MRes and an MSc in Political Science and Political Economy from the LSE, along with a B.A. from Universidad Casa Grande in my beautifully chaotic hometown of Guayaquil, Ecuador.<br>

<br>Between 2018 and 2020, I coordinated the Political Science and Political Economy Doctoral Workshop at the LSE. Beyond academia, I've served as an editorial assistant for the American Political Science Review and, prior to fully committing to research, acted as a legislative advisor in the Ecuadorian Parliament.

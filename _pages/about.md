Hi! My name is Chirayu Salgarkar, and I am a senior biomedical engineering and mathematics student at Mercer University. I plan on getting my bachelor's degree in May 2024. 

At Mercer, I am a research assistant at the Dynamical Systems and Control Laboratory, where I work on problems in safety-critical control. I currently intern at the Georgia Tech Research Institute in Warner Robins, GA, as a Research Engineer Intern. Previously, I have worked in full-stack development roles at Harris Computer, as a prosthetic fitter in Cambodia, and as a research assistant at Georgia Tech's LIDAR Lab, where I worked on bipedal robot communication. I am an alumnus of the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics.

Academically, I am currently interested in how mathematical theory can be used to guarantee safety for highly nonlinear systems. More broadly, I am interested in leveraging my technical skills in projects with high potential for positive social impact.

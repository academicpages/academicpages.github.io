I am a computational sociologist studying organizational behavior, social networks, and demography. Currently I am a Sociology PhD candidate at the University of Arizona. My dissertation uses statistical, network, and computational methods to study the antecedents and consequences of shareholder activism targeting U.S. corporate political spending practices and policies. My work (will) appears in [Journal of Marriage and Family](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jomf.12419/full), [Demography](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13524-017-0632-9), [Poetics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2018.05.001), Internaltional Journal of Comparative Sociology, and American Journal of Sociology.

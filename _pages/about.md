I am a PhD candidate in mechanical engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). I am advised by [Francesco Bullo](http://motion.me.ucsb.edu/). I was awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship in Spring 2021. My research interests lie in the analysis and control of nonlinear network systems with applications to neural networks, neuroscience, and multi-robot networks. In Spring 2020, I graduated with a B.S. in mechanical engineering and a B.S. in mathematics from the University of Maryland (UMD). While at UMD, I worked with [Yancy Diaz-Mercado](https://eng.umd.edu/clark/faculty/900/Yancy-Diaz-Mercado) on multi-robot coverage control and its applications. 

While an undergraduate student at UMD, I worked internships at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, MIT Lincoln Lab, and The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab. 

Outside of academics, I am a competitive chess player with titles of chess expert and candidate master and a US Chess Federation [rating of 2162](http://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?13928690). I am also an ultramarathon distance runner, having run a 50 mile race (and hoping to run other long-distance events in the future).

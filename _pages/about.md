Hi, Iâ€™m **Pingping Wang**, currently a **PhD student at TU Wien (Vienna University of Technology)**, working at the intersection of **sustainability** and **process systems engineering**.

My research focuses on the **integration of carbon capture and storage/utilization (CCS/CCU)** into current and future industrial infrastructures. I am developing a **prospective life cycle optimization framework** to evaluate and deploy CCS/CCU as well as **carbon dioxide removal (CDR)** technologies to mitigate **COâ‚‚ emissions** from *heavy industries* and the *atmosphere*.

By combining **prospective life cycle assessment (LCA)**, **techno-economic assessment (TEA)**, and **mathematical optimization**, I quantitatively analyze the **economic and environmental performance** of these complex systems under *multi-scenario* and *multi-period* settings. My work aims to identify **trade-offs between multi-objectives** and explore **robust and optimal solutions** under deep uncertainty.

Beyond engineering, Iâ€™m deeply curious about the **evolution and comparison of socio-economic systems** and **human behavior**, as these help me better understand **fairness in decarbonization** and *sustainable development*. 

Iâ€™m a strong supporter of **open-source projects** in **engineering**, **energy transition**, and **climate justice**â€”and Iâ€™m continuously learning how to **contribute to the open-source community**.

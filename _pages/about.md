I am a second-year Ph.D. student of transportation at the Department of Civil Engineering, [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/).  I am now working in [Smart Transport Group](https://smart-transport.github.io/) supervised by [Prof Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/). 
My current research centers on traffic control with machine learning techniques.   

Before arriving at McGill. I got a B.E. degree and an M.S. degree from the Department of Intelligent Engineering at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/cn/index.htm), China, where I mainly worked on urban network traffic prediction with deep learning. 

In my free time, I love everything related to basketball and enjoy exploring new places and food.

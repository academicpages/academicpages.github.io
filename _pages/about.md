Hi! I'm Chen, a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley. I am a member of the [Mechanical Systems Control Lab](https://msc.berkeley.edu) advised by [Prof. Masayoshi Tomizuka](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/masayoshi-tomizuka/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). During my study in Berkeley, I have also spent time in [Honda Research Institute](http://usa.honda-ri.com) and [Waymo](https://waymo.com) as intern.

The goal of my research is to develop trustworthy and safe intelligent autonomous systems interacting with humans (e.g., autonomous vehicles). I am interested in improving the transparency and robustness of learning-based autonomous systems, by incorporating domain knowledge and other techniques (e.g., model-based control, explainable AI) with deep learning models in a principled manner. Applications of my research include multi-agent trajectory prediction, interaction modeling, motion planning, and vehicle control. 

For more information, please refer to my [CV](https://ChenTangMark.github.io/files/Chen_Tang_Resume.pdf). Please feel free to contact me for research discussion and collaboration!

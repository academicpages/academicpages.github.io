I am currently a Ph.D. student at the CSE Department, the HKUST, advised by [Prof. Qiang Yang](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~qyang/) and co-advised by [Prof. Kai Chen](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~kaichen). My research interests lie in machine learning and data mining, and I am currently devoted into the newly proposed **Federated Learning**, both in algorithms and in privacy & security. I also find interest in *network analysis and mining*, such as *graph embedding and graph neural networks*. 

Prior to joining the HKUST, I spent 4 wonderful years at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), China, obtaining both a B.S in Computer Science and a B.Economics at the National School of Development. I was fortunate to have [Prof. Guojie Song](https://gjsong-pku.cn) as my advisor during my days at PKU, with whom I collaborate very well.

Miscellaneous
======
I hold a broad range of interests so as to keep enjoying life. 

I enjoy sports including jogging and basketball. My favourite team in NBA is San Antonio Spurs and my favourite football club is Liverpool FC. 

I am a civil aviation enthusiast. I am a member of the ACICFG, a team devoted to making subtitles and captions for documentaries related to civil aviation (such as the **Air Crash Investigation**). Some of our works are published on [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/358422). I also write some articles on [zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/mai-kang-ming/activities) related to civil aviation and my research. 

I am an alcoholist and I enjoy drinking, I like: 

- beers, including American IPA (I like **Ballest Point**, **Brooklyn** and **Dogfish**.), Trappist (I like **Rochefort** and **Chimay**.) and Hefeweizen (I think **Franziskaner** is good enough.),

- Vodka (**Smirnoff Black, Grey Goose and Russian Standards**.), 

- Whiskey (For single malts, I like **Talisker and Lagavulin**. For blended, **Johnnie Walker Double Black** is worth a try). 

- Bourbon (I have only tried **Maker's Mark** and I found it charming.)

An image demonstrating genres of single malt scotch is [here](http://kl4805.github.io/files/Whiskey.jpeg).

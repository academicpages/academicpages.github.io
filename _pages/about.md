Hi, I'm Paschal *(pas-kal)*.  
I'm a PhD student at Purdue University's Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, currently advised by [Prof Jamie Davis](https://davisjam.github.io/) and [Prof Aravind Machiry](https://machiry.github.io/).

## Research Interests
My research sits at the intersection of software engineering, security and cyber-physical systems. I work to improve the security and safety of embedded systems, through well-engineered software.

## Personal
Fun facts about me
- I love discussing politics, startups, and strategies. 
- I can hardly resist an invitation to join a road trip or visit a new city.
- If I'm not working or reading, I am probably watching a movie.
- I am scared of heights 😩.
- I am passionate about Nigeria, and Africa.

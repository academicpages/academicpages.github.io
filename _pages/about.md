I am Scientific Director at [OpenBiome](http://www.openbiome.org), a non-profit stool bank based in Boston. OpenBiome provides material for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for use in treating *C. difficile* infection and for research purposes.

I am a PhD scientist, interested in antimicrobial resistance and microbiome science. I did my postdoctoral training with [Yonatan Grad](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/yonatan-grad/) at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health and my PhD with [Eric Alm](http://almlab.mit.edu/) at MIT.

During my postdoc I served as the President of the [Harvard Chan Postdoc Association](http://hsph.me/pda). I was a founding member of MIT's [Biological Engineering Communciation Lab](http://bewritinglab.mit.edu/), where I co-led the development of the first [CommKit](http://mitcommlab.mit.edu/be/), a guide to communication tasks designed by scientists for scientists. I was also a founding member of the MIT [Biological Engineering REFS](http://berefs.com/), a peer-to-peer conflict management and mentoring program, and a Diversity Chair on the department's graduate student board.

I am in the midst of yet again revamping my website. If there were blog posts or material on my previous site that you liked, let me know and I'll be sure they make it back here!

## Other interests

I'm interested in how to optimally deliver technical information. I like the idea of using [rules for games](/games) as a test case, but this is far from optimized.

I produced [this list](https://github.com/swo/modern-greek-flashcards) of Modern Greek vocabulary that might be useful to learners.

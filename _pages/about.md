I am a PhD student at <a href="https://www.imtlucca.it/en" target="_blank">IMT Lucca</a> in the <a href="http://dysco.imtlucca.it/" target="_blank">Dynamical Systems, Control, and Optimization (DYSCO)</a> research group. My research interests are **system identification**, **neural networks**, **model predictive control** and **optimization**.

I received my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics in 2016 from the <a href="https://www.unilorin.edu.ng/" target="_blank">University of Ilorin</a> in Nigeria. I obtained a master’s degree in Mathematical Sciences in 2018 from the <a href="https://aims-cameroon.org/" target="_blank">African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), Cameroon</a>, and in 2021, a master’s degree in Machine Intelligence through the <a href="https://aimsammi.org/" target="_blank">African Master’s in Machine Intelligence (AMMI)</a> program at the <a href="https://aims.ac.rw/" target="_blank">African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), Rwanda</a>.

I'm a Robotics enthusiast,I have earned my master's degree in Robotics and Computer vision from Innopolis university in Russia, and got my bachelors' degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Nile university in Egypt.

Currently the keywords that most describe my research intersts are Robotics, Teleoperation, Virtual Reality, Computer Vision, Control, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Haptics, Human Robot Interaction.
My research field is related to Teleoperation and control of robotic system, 
My bachelor thesis was on control and implementation of a teleoperated robot using Virtual Reality in Hostile environment [check project](https://mostafa-metwaly.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-1/).

Master thesis project is about Haptic control and force feedback in teleoperating a kuka iiwa robot to perform a Peg In Hole task using different control modes from fully automatic, Teleoperated and using Online Learning algorithim [check project](https://mostafa-metwaly.github.io/portfolio/portfolio-6/).

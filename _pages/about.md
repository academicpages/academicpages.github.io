I am currently studying my M.Sc. in data science and engineering at [DAUIN](https://www.dauin.polito.it/), [Polytechnic University of Turin](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en). I completed my B.Sc. in mechanical engineering with a minor in computer engineering at [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en). I have research experience in deep reinforcement learning, spiking neural networks, computer vision, brain-computer interface (BCI). My current areas of interests are deep learning, reinforcement learning, spiking neural networks and computational neuroscience, and computational cognitive science.

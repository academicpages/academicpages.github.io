I am a Data Scientist by profession and am interested in applying state-of-the-art machine learning models to solve real world problems.

Biography
======

I spent five wonderful years in the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/), pursuing my PhD in Electrical Engineering: Systems, with a specialization in theoretical machine learning. I was fortunate to be advised by 
[Prof. Raj Rao Nadakuditi](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~rajnrao/) in the Applied Random Matrix Theory Group. In graduate school, I developed data driven algorithms that could leverage recent results in Random Matrix Theory to solve the Low Rank Subspace Estimation problem in the Multi Modal setting. Here is my PhD [thesis](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/140962/hnayar_1.pdf?sequence=1).


Prior to this, I spent four wonderful years at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](http://ee.iitd.ernet.in/), pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. I was advised by [Prof. Vinay Ribeiro](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~vinayr/) and [Prof. Ranjan K. Mallik](http://ee.iitd.ernet.in/people/rkmallik.html) for my undergrad thesis work.

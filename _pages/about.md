I am Tai-Quan "Winson" Peng, a Professor in the [Department of Communication](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/taiquan-winson-peng), Michigan State University.

My research interest includes computational social science, health communication, mobile analytics, and political communication. I am particularly interested in unraveling the structure & dynamics of human communication phenomena with various computational methods (e.g., network modeling, text mining, temporal and sequential modeling).

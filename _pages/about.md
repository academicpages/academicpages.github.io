## Who am I?

Hello, my name is Ali Keramati, and I am a Ph.D. student specializing in Teaching, Learning, and Educational Improvement at the [UCI School of Education](https://education.uci.edu/). I previously earned a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Educational Sciences from the University of Tehran. I proudly served as an undergraduate research assistant at several research labs, including the Cognitive Systems Lab, Technology Enhanced Learning Lab (TELAB), UT NLP Group, National Brain Centre, the University of Queensland (remotely), and the Embodied Design Research Lab at UC Berkeley (remotely).

Through my experiences as a student, teacher, and teaching assistant in academia, I noticed several challenges faced by both students and teachers that technology could address. These experiences shaped my long-term goal: **to use technology, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), to make substantial improvements in learning, teaching, and assessment.**

## Research Interests

My research research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, cognition, and education, particularly developing advanced **machine learning** and **natural language processing** methods to enhance student learning experiences and support more effective teaching practices. Specifically, I investigate the application of large language models **(LLMs)** in combination with optimization techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation **(RAG)**, **fine-tuning**, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback **(RLHF)**.

In addition to my computational interests, I am eager to work as a **digital learning designer**. I aspire to integrate my developed models into real-world classroom settings to test their effectiveness within innovative, digitalized teaching approaches. My background in learning design and research in collaborative learning fuels my passion for computer-supported collaborative learning **(CSCL)**, and I am excited to create and implement models that facilitate productive collaboration among learners. As I continue to learn and grow, I am excited to bridge the gap between technology and education, creating innovative solutions that make learning effective, accessible, and engaging for all.

Additionally, I am interested in exploring philosophical and psychological questions at the intersection of **human cognition** and LLMs, analyzing how human learning, knowledge organization, and memory compare to LLM-driven processes. Ultimately, I aim to design and benchmark **LLM-powered tools**—such as chatbots and automated educational systems—that align closely with human cognitive processes, improving educational outcomes and transforming how people learn and teach.

## Other Interests

In addition to my passion for technology, I have a deep love for the arts. From painting and music to movies and theater, I find inspiration in various creative forms. Movies and series captivate me, painting is my outlet for creativity, and music fuels my focus. Last summer, I delved into the world of acting and film direction in a school theater named [Tazeh Theater](https://www.instagram.com/tazeh_theater/?hl=en), enhancing my understanding of cinematic storytelling.

As a former and retired soccer player for [Esteghlal F.C. U17](https://www.transfermarkt.com/esteghlal-fc-u17/startseite/verein/88915), I continue my passion for the sport and occasionally join friends on the field.

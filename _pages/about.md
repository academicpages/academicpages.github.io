I am currently a Senior Researcher in the Office of the Chief Economist at Microsoft. I will join the Brown economics department as an assistant professor in the fall of 2021.

My primary research interests are in econometrics. I am also interested in labor economics and the interplay of machine learning and economics.

I received my PhD in economics from Harvard, where I was rewarded the David A. Wells prize for best disseration. Prior to coming to Harvard, I obtained a BA summa cum laude in mathematics and economics from the University of Pennsylvania.

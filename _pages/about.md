# About Me
* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), advised by Prof. [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/). [[Google Scholar Profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ixg9n-EAAAAJ&hl=en)]
* My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and probabilistic inference, as well as their applications in generative modeling, sequential decision making under uncertainty, multi-task and meta-learning, and multi-agent systems.
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). My undergraduate research advisors are Prof. [Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu), Prof. [Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/) and Prof. [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/).

About me
======
I am a PhD student in Computational Molecular Biology at the [Center for Computational Molecular Biology at Brown](https://ccmb.brown.edu) advised by [Lorin Crawford, Ph.D.](http://www.lcrawlab.com/) and [Jeffrey Bailey, Ph.D, MD](https://baileylab.org/). My research interests are broadly at the **intersection of computational modeling, computer science, statistics, and biology**. Specifically, I am interested in **developing spatio-temporal methods to understand and evaluate disease progression and drug resistance**.

Prior to attending Brown, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering from Boston University's College of Engineering in May 2022. For my bachelor's thesis, I collaborated with [Dr. Muhammad Zaman](https://www.bu.edu/zaman/profile/muhammad-zaman/) and Taylor Schissel (a current PhD student at the University of Michigan) on a "Quantitative System Analysis of Healthcare Access among Native Americans in Rosebud, SD." This project was awarded second place for the Societal Impact Award of all senior theses at the College of Engineering at Boston University and was a semi-finalist at the Rice 360 Global Health Technology Design Competition 2022. During my bachelor's, I also researched with [Dr. Franziska Michor](http://michorlab.dfci.harvard.edu) at Dana-Faber Cancer Institute on a modeling framework for estimating tumor evolutionary modes from single-cell RNA sequencing data.

Before moving to the US in 11th grade (2016), I grew up in Frankfurt, Germany, where I attended the European School of Frankfurt.

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Harvard and a Stone Scholar in Wealth and Income Inequality. My main research interests are in **labor economics** and **economics of innovation**. 

My current research focuses on the role of firms in identifying talent. In particular, I study how firms' innovation practices affect the labor market outcomes of workers, and the efficient allocation of labor in the economy. My works rely on a combination of novel datasets, causal inference, and structural methods.

<!-- In my job market paper, I study asymmetric employer learning in the labor market for computer scientists. I build a dynamic framework to consider firms' endogenous investment in learning under monopsonistic competition, exploit differential timing of innovation disclosure to test for asymmetric employer learning, and quantify its impact on job mobility and innovation productivity via structural estimation. --> 

I am on the 2023-2024 job market. Please find my [CV here](/files/AW_CV_2023.pdf), and my job market paper on the research page.

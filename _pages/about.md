I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I lead the [Perception and LANguage (PLAN) Lab](https://plan-lab.github.io/). My research interests are broadly defined at the intersection of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science. My work revolves around machine learning challenges related to data, e.g., learning with limited imperfect supervision, self-supervision, zero-shot learning, adversarial training, essentially work under the theme of <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Data Quality in Machine Learning</span>, and multi-modal learning with applications to <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen">Vision + Language</span>, e.g., (bio)medical imaging, embodied AI, language grounding, text-to-video generation, etc. Overall, I am interested in building intelligent task assistants that augment human intelligence. I have extensively collaborated on transdisciplinary projects that touch societal dimensions, in areas ranging from Health Informatics and Genomics to Education, Manufacturing, and Social Computing. Before joining iSchool@Illinois, I was an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Virginia Tech, a core faculty member of the [Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence and Discovery Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu/), and an affiliate faculty member of the [National Security Institute](https://nationalsecurity.vt.edu) and the [Center for Advanced Innovation in Agriculture](https://caia.cals.vt.edu/). 

<!-- In 2019, I spent a year as a research scientist (Research Staff Member) at IBM Almaden Research Center, working on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing,  and Information Retrieval problems. I obtained my Ph.D. from the [Computer Science Department](http://cs.illinois.edu), [University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign](http://illinois.edu), under the supervision of Prof. [ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu), [Text Information Management and Analysis Group (TIMAN)](http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir). I was selected as an [EECS Rising Star](https://publish.illinois.edu/rising-stars/) participant in 2019. -->

In both normal tissue and disease states, cells interact with one another,
and with the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is a meshwork
of proteins that cells produce and degrade. Cells also adhere to the ECM, exert
forces on it, and move through it under specific circumstances. Cell-cell and
cell-ECM interactions are fundamental in determining cell and tissue fates, and
the outcomes of normal development, wound healing, and cancer
metastasis. I combine biological, computational, and mathematical
methods to understand such processes.

Interactions between cells, ECM, and tissue range over several orders of
magnitude in time and spatial scales. Distinct mathematical frameworks are
appropriate for specific levels of detail. For example, differential equations
(DEs) that track changes in cell densities, are suitable for describing large
cell populations, when individual details are less important. I refer to such
descriptions as <i>continuum models (CMs)</i>. On the other hand, to track
the motion, behaviour, or forces produced by individual cells, a more detailed
computational framework is needed: here, each cell is described at a finer
level of detail. I refer to such models as <i>cell-based models (CBMs)</i>.

Traditional continuum models (partial differential equations, PDEs) are based on
purely local interactions. Unfortunately, such PDE models ignore important
nonlocal effects in tissues, such as long-ranged forces between cells
transmitted by the ECM, and long cell protrusions contacting far away cells.
The advantage of my proposed research is that I develop methods to describe
nonlocal phenomena, in both the continuum and the physics-based CBMs.

The combination of continuum and cell-based models is a reoccurring theme in my
research. Each brings benefits to the insights and understanding of complex
problems. CBMs allow for the inclusion of rich detail based on
physical laws, and visualization of individual behaviour. CMs
permit me to harness computational and analytical tools that the mathematics
community has built up over many decades. The methods also have limitations:
large processing power requirements of CBMs limit them to small cell
populations, versus limited level of detail in CMs.

Research Motivation
------------------
In 2017, the Canadian Cancer Society reported that an estimated 206,200
Canadians will be diagnosed with cancer this year. Cancer has a devastating
effect on the lives of many Canadians. While significant advances in treatment
have been made to date, we are still far from a cure. One of the deadliest
hallmarks of cancer is its ability to invade distant tissues (metastasis).
Central to the development of successful new treatments is a fundamental
understanding of the biological, chemical, and physical triggers of cell
invasion. My work harnesses the tools of mathematics, physics and scientific
computation to address this problem at the basic science level, in partnership
with mathematical and biological experts. Data from in-vitro cell invasion
experiments will guide model formulation, and key questions to address.

In both normal tissue and disease states, cells interact with one another, and
with the extracellular matrix (ECM), a fibrous scaffold surrounding them. Cells
adhere to and pull on the ECM. Cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions are
fundamental in regulating both normal (e.g. developmental) and abnormal
(malignant) cell motility. My novel mathematical models of cell-cell and
cell-ECM adhesion will facilitate deeper understanding of how these play out in
cell collective behaviour. My in-silico (computational) experiments offer
rigorous testing of our biological understanding and suggest new biological
experiments.

Many cell interactions occur distances much greater than typical cell size. My
work addresses a long-standing challenge of modelling such non-local phenomena.
I propose, the development of new mathematical tools to describe and analyze
such non-local interactions. For example, many of the classical notions from
calculus have to be revisited, revised and extended to account for long-ranged
influences. These developments advance the methods of applied mathematics.

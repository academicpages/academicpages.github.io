Hey there! I'm Nate, a data enthusiast who believes in the power of numbers to tell compelling stories and drive meaningful change. When I'm not diving into lines of code or exploring the latest in machine learning, you might find me on the tennis court or playing basketball. Currently, I'm pursuing my passion for data science and computer science at Emory University, where I get to combine analytical thinking with creative problem-solving.

Think of me as a data detective with a twist - I use computational tools to uncover insights about everything from climate change patterns to cultural trends in social media. My journey in tech isn't just about crunching numbers; it's about using data to make a real difference in how we understand and interact with the world around us.

Research Focus
======
My research interests span across multiple domains, where I get to play with some fascinating questions:

* How do words rise and fall in popularity over time? (Emory's Cultural Analytics Lab)
* Can we predict climate disasters using social media chatter? (Villanova University)
* How can we make AI reason more like humans? (Tsinghua University's Future Intelligence Lab)
* What did the pandemic teach us about human mobility? (Maryland Transportation Institute)

Industry Experience
======
I've had the chance to apply my data skills in some interesting real-world scenarios:

* **YSTen Technology Co., Ltd.** - Decoded user behavior patterns in TV viewership
* **HireBeat Inc.** - Predicted employment trends using big data
* **Chinese American Chamber of Commerce** - Used data to bridge policy and community needs

Leadership & Community Impact
======
I believe technology should serve a greater purpose:

* Teaching blockchain basics to curious minds at EmoryDAO
* Co-founded an alliance that raised $1500+ for frontline workers during COVID-19
* Helping break down language barriers in education through COVE
* Using data to advocate for AAPI community needs

Technical Toolkit
======
My favorite tools for turning ideas into reality:

* **Programming**: Python, Java, SQL
* **Data Analysis**: Natural Language Processing, Statistical Modeling, Data Mining
* **Visualization**: PowerBI, Tableau
* **Languages**: English and Mandarin (because sometimes the best insights come in different languages)

What Gets Me Excited
======
I love working on projects that:
* Use text analysis to uncover hidden patterns in human communication
* Apply machine learning to tackle climate change
* Help communities make better decisions through data
* Bridge the gap between technical solutions and real-world impact

When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you'll probably find me serving aces on the tennis court, shooting hoops, or tickling the ivory keys of a piano. I'm always up for interesting conversations about data, tech, or how we can use both to make the world a bit better.

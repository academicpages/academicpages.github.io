---

I’m a full-stack .NET software developer with a strong focus on backend systems and modern frontend development using Angular. I specialize in building scalable and secure web applications using .NET Core, C#, and TypeScript, often integrated with Auth0 for authentication and deployed in cloud environments like Azure and AWS.

💼 **Professional Experience**  
I’ve contributed to projects across the e-commerce and financial sectors, developing microservices and full-stack solutions with a focus on performance, maintainability, and user access control.  
- **React:** Used in business-facing dashboard and frontend tools within production systems.  
- **WordPress:** Built and customized client websites, including custom themes and plugin configurations to meet business needs.  
- **Auth0 Integration:** Designed secure authentication flows across Angular and .NET Core apps.  
While I have experience with Python-based networking applications (e.g., basic client-server models), my professional focus remains on enterprise-level full-stack .NET solutions.

🎓 **Academic Background**  
- Computer Science major with a strong foundation in data structures, operating systems, and distributed systems

I'm a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley and a Research Associate at the [Center on the Politics of Development](https://cpd.berkeley.edu/). My research interests include gender, decision-making influence, development and the environment. Current collaborative projects map barriers to women representatives' power and test solutions to mitigate these barriers, in rural India.

Prior to Berkeley, I was a Fulbright-Nehru Research Fellow and Lombard Fellow affiliated with the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics in Pune, India. I also worked for the Women’s Economic Empowerment Unit at the U.S. Department of State in Washington, D.C., Vera Solutions in Mumbai, India, and Chhori (Daughter) in Kathmandu, Nepal. I hold an MSc in Economics from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne and a BA in Political Science and South Asian Studies from Dartmouth College.

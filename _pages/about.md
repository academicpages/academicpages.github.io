I am currently a third year Electrical Engineering Doctorate Student at NYU Tandon. I recieved my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Santa Clara University, graduating Summa Cum Laude in June 2022. My research interests focus on the intersection between Electromagnetics and Wireless Communications. The topic that I am researching right now is electromagnetic feedback receiver arrays--adding interspersed feedback transmitters to the receivers of an antenna array in order to create an electromagnetic parallel to the frequency response of the mammalian cochlea. Previously, I have researched topics such as Direct Antenna Modulation, and the use of Software Defined Radios for Hydrogen Line Radio Astronomy.

I'm a philosopher and cognitive scientist engaged in both theoretical and experimental research in embodied cognitive science. The primary focus of my research is on the implications of embodiment for how we make sense of "higher cognition" and technologically-supported problem solving, including in scientific practice. My main influences are the scientific traditions of Gibsonian ecological psychology and dynamical systems theory, and the philosophical traditions of pragmatism and phenomenology. 




About me
======

Since May 2020 I'm an assistant lecturer and researcher ("Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter") at Technische Universität Berlin, where I founded and lead the <a href="https://embody-rg.github.io/" target="_blank">EMBODY Research Group</a> (the name stands for _**E**xploring **M**ind and **B**ehavior in **O**rganism-environment **DY**namics_). At TU Berlin I am supported by my interdisciplinary mentors Miriam Kyselo (<a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/m.kyselo" target="_blank">NTNU, Philosophy</a> and <a href="https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/people/miriam-kyselo/" target="_blank">TU Berlin, Science of Intelligence Cluster</a>) and Klaus Gramann (TU Berlin, <a href="https://www.bpn.tu-berlin.de/menue/biological_psychology_and_neuroergonomics/parameter/en/" target="_blank">Biological Psychology and Neuroergonomics</a> and <a href="https://blogs.tu-berlin.de/bpn_bemobil/" target="_blank">BeMoBIL</a>).

Before coming to TU Berlin, I received my PhD in philosophy from the University of Cincinnati (working with <a href="https://www.angelapotochnik.com/" target="_blank">Angela Potochnik</a>). There I also received graduate training in experimental psychology at the Center for Cognition, Action, & Perception (working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=z9FExgcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate" target="_blank">Paula Silva</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-RAPSx4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Tony Chemero</a>). Previously, I earned a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree in philosophy from the University of São Paulo, in Brazil (working with <a href="https://filosofia.fflch.usp.br/en/professores/osvaldo-frota-pessoa-junior" target="_blank">Osvaldo Frota Pessoa Jr</a>) and I was a visiting master's student for two semesters with <a href="https://mbb.harvard.edu/people/nancy-nersessian" target="_blank">Nancy Nersessian</a> at the Georgia Institute of Technology and for one semester at Georgia State University. 

For 6 years my wife and I had a backyard farm in Cincinnati, with <a href="https://gui-cogsci.github.io/images/goats2016.jpg" target="_blank">miniature dairy goats</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gui.br/videos/10209876057245259/?l=6129363546072657550" target="_blank">rabbits</a>, <a href="https://gui-cogsci.github.io/images/chickens2015.jpg" target="_blank">chickens</a>, and a vegetable garden. Our new big project is to <a href="https://gui-cogsci.github.io/images/airportfamily2020.jpg" target="_blank">raise a human being</a>. Thankfully, here in Berlin we live just one block away from <a href="https://gui-cogsci.github.io/images/babygoat2021.jpg" target="_blank">a community garden that has goats and chickens</a>.

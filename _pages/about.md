I'm Leonardo Pacciani-Mori /leo&#39;nardo pa&#39;tʃːani &#39;mɔːri/, a PhD student in Physics at the University of Padua. I work in the [Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics](https://liphlab.com/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> under the supervision of Amos Maritan and Samir Suweis. I have also been appointed as *Fellow of the Department of Physics* of Harvard University, working in [David Nelson's](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/nelson){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> and [Andrew Murray's](https://murraylab.fas.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> groups under the supervision of [Andrea Giometto](https://www.cee.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/andrea-giometto){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->.

<!--I work in the broad field of biological physics: I use methods and approaches characteristic of statistical physics to create models of biological and living systems.<br>-->
My current main research interest is the study of how adaptation in consumer-resource models can help us understand better how microbial systems works, ranging from the dynamics of a single microbe to the coexistence of several species in one community.

<!--### Random fun facts
* My current [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 3
* I have read the whole *In Search of Lost Time* by Marcel Proust during summer 2017-->

As of August 2021, I'm a [WASP](https://wasp-sweden.org/) assistant professor in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the Department of Information Technology at Uppsala University. My research interests are primarily in the intersection of machine learning, optimization and control.

Prior to joining Uppsala University, I was a senior research scientist at the radiotherapy company [Elekta](www.elekta.com) where I was also an industrial PhD student supervised by Prof. Hans Knutsson at the Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV) at Linköping University.

At Elekta, I did research on machine learning, optimization and medical image analysis (MRI in particular) which resulted in more than 20 patent applications. I'm particularly proud of my work on dose optimization which formed the basis for [Leksell Gamma Knife Lightning](https://www.elekta.com/radiosurgery/leksell-gamma-knife-lightning/).

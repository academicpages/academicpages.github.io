I'm a graduate in **Mathematics** from Trinity College Dublin, currently working as a **Risk Consultant** at Murex. I have a strong interest in **Finance**, **Statistics**, **Music**, and **Sports**, and am actively engaged in projects that focus on **Computational Mathematics** and **Probability**.

## Selected Projects

### Credit Risk Project for Authorisation Strategies

While working at Murex, I have been investigating various authorisation strategies for calculating counterparty credit risk, including **Pre-Settlement Risk** and **Settlement Risk**, from an analytical perspective. This project involved implementing algorithms capable of handling large volumes of trades. 

Some key outcomes include:
- Identifying scenarios where alternative risk calculation strategies underperform (underestimate exposure).
- Analysing **Monte Carlo simulations** and the percentage growth of the strategies.

### Final Year Thesis: Finite Element Method for Differential Equations

In my undergraduate thesis, I explored the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** for solving 1D and 2D differential equations like the **Laplace Equation** and **Heat Equation**, along with **Elliptic PDEs**. Using **MATLAB**, I developed programs to solve these equations with **numerical quadrature**, applying the method to the **Black-Scholes equation** for pricing European Call/Put options.

### Miscellaneous Projects in Probability + Python

These projects cover a variety of topics in **Probability** and **Python**, featuring a collection of short research papers and code that you can run yourself. The aim is to explore interesting and challenging concepts through practical examples.

I'm a post-doc at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, working with David Fitzpatrick on the tree shrew visual system. My background and training are in engineering and modeling, although these days I'm an experimental systems neuroscientist.

My goal is to develop an understanding of the structural and functional organization of the visual system as a whole using a multi-scale measurement approach. For the near future, my focus will be on the 'extrastriate' visual cortex, the relatively unexplored parts of the visual system beyond the primary visual cortex. These areas receive and send information to subcortical and cortical visual regions and interact with the rest of the brain during perception and action. But they are a little bit more difficult to study for various practical reasons.

I've learned from my experience with mice, rats, and cats, that cross-species studies can be an important tool in the search for architectural principles. Over the past few years, I've worked on establishing the tree shrew as an animal model of the extrastriate visual system. In most recent [study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.08.416651v3) I discovered a unique map of visual space in the secondary visual cortex (V2) of tree shrews. This unusual mapping challenges our understanding of topographic maps and their development AND is likely to be the basis for the famous striped organization of V2 in primates and other species.

I'm currently working on the structural/functional characterization of the rest of the tree shrew extrastriate, including the emergence of motion selectivity along the visual cortical hierarchy. My next set of projects will involve development of topographic organization in these areas.

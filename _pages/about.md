I am currently working as an ML Engineering Consultant at Tredence Inc., Bengaluru. with 5 years of experience in
building enterprise-scale machine learning models, furnishing insights, providing analytical solutions and business intelligence to guide impactful data driven decisions. I have consulted numerous Fortune 500 companies like Unilever, Sysco Foods, American Eagle etc.

I am also an independent Applied ML Researcher collaborating with scholars across the globe trasforming state-of-the-art research in Machine Learning into solutions designed to tackle problems across health-care, business intelligence, cyber-security etc.

I travel to explore stories, food and culture. I'm of that kind who goes to trips without a planned return ticket. During my free times, I'm glued to books like a bookish gecko with library obsession. I am always up for conversations related to Art, AI and Philosophy preferable over coffee, extra preferably at a book cafe :D

Welcome to my space. Thanks for stopping by!

*“We are travelers on a cosmic journey,stardust,swirling and dancing in the eddies and whirlpools of infinity. Life is eternal. We have stopped for a moment to encounter each other, to meet, to love, to share.This is a precious moment. It is a little parenthesis in eternity.”*
― Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist

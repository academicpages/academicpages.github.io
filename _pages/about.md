I am a second-year PhD student at LAMSADE, under the supervision of Denis Cornaz and Clément Royer.
My thesis focuses on the study of PSSs (positive spanning sets), families of vectors spanning the whole euclidian space by combinations with positive coefficients. Using graph theory, I study the structure of such families. I also look for new ways to use PSSs in derivative-free algorithms.

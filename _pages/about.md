I'm a second-year graduate student at the [School of Automation](https://automation.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/). My research interests include computer vision, 3D vision, and embodied AI, with a current focus on 3D hand-object interaction and physics-based grasping.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yangang Wang](https://www.yangangwang.com/). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/).

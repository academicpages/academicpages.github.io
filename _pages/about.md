I am an engieer by nature and a scientist by training. My career interests primarily include machine learning for computer vision and computer graphics with the focus on 3D human body in motion.

Building the future of sports content viewing on the Metaverse is what takes me to work every day as Prinicipal Computer Vision Engineer at [Sporttotal.tv](https://sporttotal.tv/). Basically we turn human players in images of football games into motion-accurate digitized 3D avatar parameters that effeciently enable on-demand immersive 3D viewing of the game and scalable data analysis.

Previously I was an Applied Research Scientist at [Kaia Health GmbH](https://kaiahealth.com/), and before I was a Research Engineer at the  [Perceiving Systems Department](https://www.youtube.com/user/BlackAtBrown) of the [Max-Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://www.is.mpg.de/) lead by [Michael Black](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/black).

I have a BSc. in Electrical Engineering from [Tabriz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWb1yP-KpMc) Azad University, 
[Iran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuITzmlIvbc), and MSc. in [Neural Information Processing](https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/master/neural-inf-process/) 
from [Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen](https://www.neuroschool-tuebingen.de/), Germany.

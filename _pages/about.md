Welcome to my personal website. I am a Research Fellow in the [Meel group](https://meelgroup.github.io), at the School of Computing of the National University of Singapore. I am currently working on the development of new techniques for maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) solving and for counting the number of satisfying assignments to Boolean formulae (model counting, or #SAT).

I recently defended [my dissertation](https://hdl.handle.net/1887/3455662), *Optimal decision-making under constraints and uncertainty*, at Leiden University (NL). Part of the research therein was conducted while I was a visiting researcher at Université catholique de Louvain (BE) and the University of Toronto (CA).

If you would like to know more about my current position, research interests and achievements, please check out [my cv](https://latower.github.io/cv/). You will find a list of code and publications on [this page](https://latower.github.io/publications/).

<!-- I am currently a research assistant in Academia Sinica working on the architecture for the next generation memory. My research interests includes: Computer Architecture, Non‐Volatile Memory, Graph Analytics Accelerators. -->

<!-- I have been interested in the hardware/software co-design of computing systems since my undergraduate study. I was first fascinated by the power of parallel computing (especially GPUs) and software-level optimizations; however, I then noticed that it is necessary to understand the hardware system to come up with a thorough solution. Therefore, I have been polishing my hardware design skills and designing my own chips (FPGAs and ASICs) since my master's study. Moreover, I set foot in the field of emerging memory and found that it is a promising candidate in the post-Moore’s law era, so my master's thesis is about the performance modeling of a graph analytics accelerator based on non-volatile memory systems. Aside from these research topics, I have experience in some open-source RISC-V emulators and RV-based CNN accelerators. -->

Traditionally, optimizing wireless networks involved labor-intensive hand-engineering, which was time-consuming. Now, AI can train radio signal types in a matter of hours, performing signal detection and classification far more quickly than traditional methods. These advancements not only speed up the process but also reduce power consumption and computational requirements. AI facilitates end-to-end learning, enabling the optimization of radio systems by prioritizing key design parameters like throughput, latency, range, and power consumption.

Intro
------
Hi everyone, my name is Jenny Wang and this is a website I am messing around in.

By day, I am a Software Team Lead and QA Engineer. I am responsible for the day to day running and coordination for the latest
prototype of Transparent Language. I manage the agile backlog of JIRA issues as a Scrum Master and coordinate between
Development, Product Management, and QA departments. On the side I write automated tests and review PRs for the development 
team. 

All this means is I deliver a satisfying language learning experience while ensure our products use the most cutting edge technology.

Potential Blog Post #1
## Topic: What is your dream job? or Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
I have a passion for efficiency. The thrill of being able to accomplish goals before deadlines gives me the greatest rush. A planner at heart, I find great enjoyment in breaking down seemingly unsurmountable problems into manageable increments. I would assume that's what lead to my interest in the field of technology. It allows my left brain to go wild; organize and prioritize my to do list to my heart's content. After all, all of lifes problems are just an app away from being solved. 
Being so data driven has helped me in many ways in my life. Math was always my favorite subject. I would always be the friend who had the detailed iternary for any upcoming trip, making sure we would be able to hit up every scenic location and still be on time to reservations at the restaruant we saw on instagram the other day. #foodie
At this stage of my life, I am interested in growing my analytical mindset to help solve real world problems. I would love to continue to travel and learn from other to help expand my perspective. I am actively exploring ways to strengthen my creativity with my [photography] (https://www.instagram.com/hello.jennyw/) This is me on my journey of self discovery and finding happiness.

#### If you were an animal which one would you be?
A lot of people have commented that I remind them of a dog: strong, loyal, happy-go-lucky. I however just visited the Atlanta Aquarium and have to say my favorite animal on display was the egg yolk jellyfish. The serene nature of these gentle aquatic creatures resonated with me. Perhaps I was just hungry.

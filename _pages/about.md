Hi! My name is Ting Chen and I'm an undergraduate senior at the University of Richmond studying Computer Science and Mathematical Economics. I'm currently applying to PhD programs and am broadly interested in Bayesian and nonparametric statistics as well as their applications in machine learning and natural language processing methods.

I am currently an undergraduate student major in Mathematics in [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). 

I have laid solid foundations in analysis, algebra and number theory during the study in my undergraduate school. Despite great enthusiasm in mathematics, I found that my true interest lies in Artificial Intelligence. In parallel with my study, I applied for two research projects concerning AI and data science. It was my greatest honor to work under the guidance of Prof. [Xingjun Ma](http://xingjunma.com/) and Prof. [Shuqin Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shu-Qin-Zhang).

I'm a graduate in Mathematics from Trinity College Dublin, currently working as a Risk Consultant at Murex. 

I have a strong interest in Finance, Statistics, Music, and Sports, and am actively engaged in projects that focus on Computational Mathematics.

### Applying Stochastic Processes to Financial Modelling

In this short project, I create a short HTML Document that explains how you can apply Stochastic Calculus (Geometric Brownian Motion, OU Process) to predict trends for Index Funds

### Final Year Thesis: Finite Element Method for Differential Equations

In my undergraduate thesis, I explored the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** for solving 1D and 2D differential equations like the **Laplace Equation** and **Heat Equation**, along with **Elliptic PDEs**. Using **MATLAB**, I developed programs to solve these equations with **numerical quadrature**, applying the method to the **Black-Scholes equation** for pricing European Call/Put options.

### Credit Risk Project for Authorisation Strategies

While working at Murex, I have been investigating various authorisation strategies for calculating counterparty credit risk, including **Pre-Settlement Risk** and **Settlement Risk**, from an analytical perspective. This project involved implementing algorithms capable of handling large volumes of trades. 

Some key outcomes include:
- Identifying scenarios where alternative risk calculation strategies underperform (underestimate exposure).
- Analysing **Monte Carlo simulations** and the percentage growth of the strategies.

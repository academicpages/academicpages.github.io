## About Me
**Hilal Gure** is a Registered Nurse and Electronics Engineering student specializing in **microtechnology and computer systems** at the University of South-Eastern Norway.

With several years of experience from **Akershus University Hospital** and **Vestfold Hospital Trust**, I’ve worked across cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, and infectious medicine.

I combine my clinical background with a growing passion for **embedded systems, sensors, and data-driven solutions** that can strengthen patient safety and address workforce challenges in healthcare.

Beyond healthcare and technology, I’m also engaged in **local politics and community development** as a municipal council member in Lørenskog Municipality.

I am a lecturer in games and part-time PhD student working on sound rendering, computer graphics, and vision under the supervision of [Dr Carlo Harvey](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/computing/about-us/our-staff/carlo-harvey) and [Dr Maite Frutos](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/computing/about-us/our-staff/dr-maite-frutos-pascual), and the external help of [Dr Alan Dolhasz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dolhasz/?originalSubdomain=uk).
I currently teach a range of modules within BSc Video Game Development at Birmingham City University and have. Before, I worked on several research projects as an intern at the DMT Lab. Among these was the [WMCA Serrano](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/computing/research/digital-media-technology/research-projects/a-vision-based-system-for-road-traffic-monitoring) project, in collaboration with the West Midlands Combined Authority, which developed methods of analysis for intelligent traffic monitoring technology based on computer vision. I obtained a first-class degree in BSc (Hons) in Sound Engineering and Production (2019) from Birmingham City University, taking advantage of the final year project to conduct a subjective study on auditory perception in virtual environments.

As part of ongoing research I am conducting, I have developed [my own spatialiser system](https://github.com/MattXV/DSPToolbox) for the Hololens 2 AR Headset as I needed one that included the ability to hot-swap HRTFs and had control over real-time Impulse Response convolutions. If you are an AR developer, facing similar issues, feel free to get in touch with me.

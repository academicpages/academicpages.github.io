I am a PhD student in Computer Vision at 
Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, 
University of Zagreb. My advisor and life coach is [Siniša Šegvić](http://www.zemris.fer.hr/~ssegvic/).

My current research focuses on future anticipation in driving scenarios.
The ability of machines to anticipate and reason about the future
could be crucial in development and integration of autonomous driving systems.
It allows planning of actions not only by looking at the past,
but at the forecasted future as well.
For example, knowing future location of pedestrian could enable
potentially life-saving decisions.
Currently, I am more more oriented towards the forecasting at the semantic level (e.g. semantic segmentation),
rather than raw RGB frames. However, raw frame forecasting is also interesting and challenging problem.


In my free time I like to hang out with my friends, ride a bike and attend a pub quiz with my fantastic team DanceNet-121.
Now, I hope to publish some interesting posts on my blog about computer vision and stuff.

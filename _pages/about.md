I’m a senior electrical engineering student at Amirkabir university of technology (AUT) Tehran polytechnic. My research interest is to build intelligent applications, which model data for understanding users’ status clearly, and provide people with better services, by utilizing methods in natural language processing, Computer Vision, Data Mining and machine learning techniques. I currently work with Dr. Menhaj and Dr. Taheri on My Bsc thesis which is about recognizing human facial expressions with machine learning.

## About My Research

My research focuses on AI and robotics for construction applications, with particular emphasis on:

* **AI and Machine Learning for Human-Robot Collaboration**: Developing algorithms that enable seamless collaboration between humans and robots in construction environments
* **Computer Vision for Automated Inspection**: Creating computer vision techniques for automated inspection tasks, including real-time roof defect segmentation
* **Construction Robotics**: Advancing robotic construction technologies, including 3D printing, robotic control, and navigation systems
* **Digital Architecture and Computational Design**: Exploring computational design methods and their integration with robotic fabrication
* **Immersive Technologies for Safety Training**: Developing VR-based training systems for construction safety, particularly for human-robot collaborative scenarios

My work combines robotics, computer vision, machine learning, and human-computer interaction to improve construction safety, efficiency, and quality. I have experience in developing software interfaces for robotic construction, programming robot arms for large-scale 3D printing, and creating immersive training environments using ROS and Unity.

Welcome to our page! The London AI for Source Code group is an active research hub with researchers and academics interested in all applications of AI on source code. Our meetup interests include but are not limited to:

- Bug detection and repair
- Source code synthesis, refactoring or summarization
- Source code datasets for machine learning applications
- Information retrieval for source code
- Source code representations
- Source code pattern mining
- Frameworks that facilitate all the above categories
- And so on...

Once a month, esteemed speakers from around the world are invited to share their latest research work in our 40-minute sessions. The meetups conclude with questions and discussion on new ideas. Our aim is to bring together like-minded researcher and academics, stay up-tp-date with the latest developments and of course networking.

**All are welcome!**

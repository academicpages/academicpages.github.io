I am a PhD student at Monash University working on gamma-ray bursts, neutron stars and gravitational waves under the supervision of Paul Lasky and Greg Ashton.
I am a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC) and the Australian research council centre for excellence for gravitational-wave discovery, OzGrav. Starting from November, I will be joining NORDITA (Stockholm) as a NORDITA Fellow.

* 1st June 2021: _The evolution of binary neutron star post-merger remnants: a review_ accepted in General Relativity and Gravitation.
* 24th May 2021: _CDF XT1: The off-axis afterglow of a neutron star merger at z = 2.23_ submitted to ApJL.
* 23-26 March 2021: I gave a virtual talk at the THESEUS conference. See slides [here](https://www.isdc.unige.ch/theseus/posters-slides.html)
* February 2021: Pleased to finally announce that I have accepted a postdoctoral fellowship at NORDITA. Looking forward to moving to Sweden in November.
* January 2021: I passed my pre-submission milestone for my PhD! This is the last milestone before I submit my thesis in mid July.
* November 27th 2020: _The evolution of binary neutron star post-merger remnants: a review_ submitted to General Relativity and Gravitation.
* November 23rd-27th 2020: This week I am attending the annual OzGrav retreat.  
* 16th November 2020: Today I am giving an invited talk at Caltech.
* September 2020: _Interpreting the X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts with radiative losses and millisecond magnetars_ accepted in MNRAS.
* August 2020: I gave a couple more remote talks this month. One at the Flatiron Institute, and another at the University of California, Berkeley.
* August 2020: Submitted _Interpreting the X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts with radiative losses and millisecond magnetars_ to MNRAS. See it on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05745).
* July 2020: Over the last month I have given several talks remotely, this remote adventure concludes this week with talks at the University of Bath, Leicester, Gran Sasso and Swinburne. Pleased to be able to present my work at so many different places, unfortunate downside that it had to be remotely.
* 3rd June 2020: Submitted _Bayesian inference for compact binary coalescences with BILBY: Validation and application to the first LIGO--Virgo gravitational-wave transient catalogue_ to MNRAS. See it on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00714)
* 8th March 2020: _Gravitational waves or deconfined quarks: what causes the premature collapse of neutron stars born in short gamma-ray bursts?_ accepted in PRD.
* 4th March 2020: My recent paper is in the news! see article [here](https://www.monash.edu/science/news/current/new-study-reveals-possible-formation-of-massive-neutron-stars-from-stellar-collision/_nocache) on the Monash website and [here](https://www.ozgrav.org/news/new-study-reveals-possible-formation-of-massive-neutron-stars-from-stellar-collision) on OzGrav!
* January 16th 2020: Submitted _Gravitational waves or deconfined quarks: what causes the premature collapse of neutron stars born in short gamma-ray bursts?_ to PRD. See it on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06102). This paper took a long time but it was well worth it.
* November 17th-22nd November: This week I am in Lorne, Victoria for the Annual OzGrav retreat and ECR workshop.  
* November 8th: After a long productive trip in Japan my visit comes a conclusion. Met heaps of amazing people, started several collaborations, lots of exciting science to come.
* October 27th-3rd November: This week, I am the Yamada meeting on gamma-ray-bursts in the beautiful city of Yokohama. I am presenting a couple of posters on my work on the population properties of long-lived neutron star merger remnants and extension of millisecond-magnetar models to include radiative losses.
* September 24 - October 25th: This month, I am in Kyoto attending the Yukawa institute long-term workshop on Multi-messenger astrophysics in the
gravitational-wave era
* July 7-12th: Attended the ASA conference at the University of Queensland, Brisbane.

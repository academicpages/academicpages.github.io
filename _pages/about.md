I'm a MS student at UC San Diego in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department with focus on Robotics. I finished my Undergraduation fromIndian Institute of Technology Hyderabad [IITH](https://iith.ac.in/) in the Electrical Department. During my time there I worked with Prof. Summohana Channappayya on Scene Understanding using Semantic Mapping and Object detection Deep Leanring Models. I was also a part of the [Pranet Lab](https://pranet.iith.ac.in/) where I worked with Prof. Kotaro Kataoka on the application of DAG blockchain in IoT.

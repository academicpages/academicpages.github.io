About Me
======
I am a robotics engineer with 5 years of experience using machine learning and optimisation techniques for the development of robot morphologies and controllers. I was a postdoctoral researcher working under the supervision of Professor Dario Floreano in the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland where I contributed to the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (MERGING). Before that, I was a PhD candidate in the Soft Robotics Group at the University of Bristol, supervised were Professor Helmut Hauser and Professor Jonathan Rossiter.

I am a Data Scientist at UnitedHealthcare. My work revolves around marketing analytics and member targeting using machine learning and statistical analysis. I am currently delving into the complexities of experimentation and causal inference.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring National Parks, playing badminton, crocheting, and indulging in [photography](https://unsplash.com/@rputtam).

Check out my work in the Portfolio and Blog sections. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating on projects or research papers in the field of AI/ML!

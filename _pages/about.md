I’m a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Public Health at UC Berkeley. My career aim is to find interventions for cancer treatment and prevention, and I have a particular focus on brain tumors. My background is as a geneticist and bioinformatician, and I am keen to integrate omic data of multiple types in order to form strong conclusions on the causes of cancer and to lead study for therapies. I am currently developing bioinformatic and statistical pipelines for the analysis of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry data to determine alterations of protein adducts and metabolites in cancer samples in Dr. Stephen Rappaport's laboratory at UC Berkeley. This work is in close collaboration with Dr. Sandrine Dudoit's biostatistics laboratory.

I play an active role in the brain tumor research community. Every year I attend and present at the Society of Neuro-Oncology annual meeting. I am a highly collaborative bioinformatician in the field. I also participate in fundraising activities and was invited to give a speech at the National Brain Tunor Society walk that takes place in San Francisco each year. 

In my personal life I love to be outdoors and the bay area is a fantastic place to do that. At weekends you will find me out hiking, running and kayaking. The nature here is very different from my home country, the UK, and I enjoy learning about it. I regularly practice yoga and meditation and find that it improves my concentration which is a must in the field I work in! Besides that, I love to have my family and friends around me - a dinner party out on my deck in Berkeley is my favorite evening pastime!

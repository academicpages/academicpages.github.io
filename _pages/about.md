I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Neurobiology program at the California Institute of Technology ([Caltech](https://neuroscience.caltech.edu/)). My advisor is Prof. [Markus Meister](https://meisterlab.caltech.edu/markusmeister). My research focuses on cognitive flexibility, learning, and memory, with a particular interest in the essence of cortex and hippocampus in these functions. My current project, titled "[Mice in the Manhattan Maze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULZqNH9vWPA&ab_channel=MouseMazeData)," employs an original massively reconfigurable maze to study rapid learning and flexible routing in wildtype mice and acortical mice. 

Beyond research, I am actively involved in teaching and student activities around Caltech. For two years, I served as the head teaching assistant for CNS187 Neural Computation, a graduate-level course requirement for students in Computation and Neural System. Additionally, I am the current president of the [Neurotechers](https://neurotechers.caltech.edu/) (23-), the official club for Caltech graduate students in neuroscience. You can learn more about me in a short [Spotlight](https://thisis.caltech.edu/person-spotlight-listing?p=2) on Caltech's frontpage, and a short assay about the [best students in class](https://magazine.caltech.edu/post/caltech-initiative-for-students). 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring the mountains, hiking in the summer and spending in the winter. This season I'm preparing for a day hike to Mt Whitney. I am also an avid bird watcher, painter and wildlife photographer. 

Before joining Caltech, I did my undergraduate studies at Cornell University (B.S. in Biological Engineering) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (B.Eng. in Food Science and Engineering). I then obtained a Master's degree (M.Phil) in Education and Psychology from the University of Cambridge.

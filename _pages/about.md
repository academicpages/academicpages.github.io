I am an undergraduate studying AI and robotics at Stanford. I work on Multi-Agent motion planning in the [Stanford Multi-Robot Systems Lab (MSL)](https://msl.stanford.edu/) with Dr. Mac Schwager and develop agile quadrupeds with Dr. Karen Liu. I have also worked on animal conservation and zoology - using computational tools from robotics and AI to study animal behavior. I previously studied movement ecology of large marine animals with Dr. Barbara Block at Stanford, and flight biomechanics with Dr. Tim Higham at UC Riverside.

Welcome. 
======
I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at Sciences Po, working under the supervision of Pierre Cahuc. My research areas include labor economics, and especially labor supply and active labor market policies. You can also find more of my research  [here](https://nicolasghio.github.io/research/). 

Prior entering the Ph.D. I worked as a research data analyst for Pr. [Jesse Rothstein](http://eml.berkeley.edu/~jrothst/) (UC Berkeley). and as a junior economist at Institut des Politiques Publiques (PSE / CREST) in Paris. You can also find my resume [here](https://nicolasghio.github.io/cv/).

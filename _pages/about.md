Hi there! I’m Shuyi Chen, a first-year Ph.D. student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Woody Zhu](https://sites.google.com/view/woodyzhu). My research spans Machine Learning (ML) and Operations Research (OR), with a focus on solving real-world problems through statistical methods.  I hold a Master's degree in Information Systems Management from CMU and a B.B.A in Supply Chain and Logistics Management from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen). You can view my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eswMnsV8OjoacEdcaGIqCpmHcAN__mmW/view?usp=sharing).

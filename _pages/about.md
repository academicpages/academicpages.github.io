Contact me at: josh \[dot\] nguyen \[at\] anu \[dot\] edu \[dot\] au

I am an MPhil student at the [Computational Media Lab](http://cm.cecs.anu.edu.au/), the Australian National University, supervised by [Lexing Xie](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~xlx/) and [Colin Klein](http://colinklein.org/). I am interested in how dilemmas come about, are presented and are justified on social media, and how to automate the reasoning process similar to that observable on online forums.

Previously I graduated with a BSc in computer science from the [School of Computing and Information Systems](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/), the University of Melbourne, Australia. 

In the summer of 2019 and winter of 2020, I worked as an intern at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-of-computer-science.html), the University of Sydney, under the supervision of Dr. [Nguyen Tran](https://nguyenhoangtran.github.io/). Our projects focused on distributed optimization and personalization, with an emphasis on designing communication-efficient distributed ML algorithms for federated learning (FL). If you are interested, I suggest taking a look at [this comprehensive survey about FL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04977.pdf).

During my undergraduate studies, I also worked with Dr. [Charl Ras](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/199833-charl-ras) at the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/), the University of Melbourne.

I publish under my official Vietnamese name, Tuan Dung Nguyen.

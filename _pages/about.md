I am a Post-Doc researcher at Utrecht University School of Economics, and a Post-Doctoral Research Associate in Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management at Cornell University. I finished a PhD in Economics from Cornell University in March 2022. My research interests include Development Economics and Labor Economics, specifically around the constraints and the incentives of human capital developments in developing countries. Geographically, my work has been concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa.

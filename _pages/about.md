I am an epidemiologist, modeler, and multidisciplinary data scientist with
experience in microbiome science, microbiology, antibiotic resistance,
statistics, computing, and mathematical modeling. I have developed skill sets
in facilitation, technical communication, and project management.

I am a part-time research analyst in the [Center for Public Health Preparedness
and Resilience](https://www.cna.org/centers/ipr/phpr/) in the [Institute for
Public Research](https://www.cna.org/centers/ipr/) at
[CNA](https://www.cna.org/). CNA is a nonprofit research institute that
provides objective analysis to federal, state, and local government.

I also work as an independent scientific consultant for
[OpenBiome](http://www.openbiome.org) and as an independent epidemiological
consultant with Dr. [Yonatan
Grad](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/yonatan-grad/).

## Background

My main research interests are antimicrobial resistance and microbiome science.

I was previously Scientific Director at
[OpenBiome](http://www.openbiome.org), a non-profit stool bank based in
Boston. OpenBiome provides material for fecal microbiota transplantation
(FMT) for use in treating *C. difficile* infection and for research.

I did my postdoctoral training with [Yonatan
Grad](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/yonatan-grad/) at the Harvard Chan School
of Public Health, where I focused on antimicrobial resistance, and my PhD
with [Eric Alm](http://almlab.mit.edu/) at MIT, where I worked in
environmental microbiology, human microbiome science, and clinical trial
design.

At MIT, I was a founding member of MIT's [Biological Engineering
Communciation Lab](http://bewritinglab.mit.edu/), where I co-led the
development of the first [CommKit](http://mitcommlab.mit.edu/be/), a guide to
communication tasks designed by scientists for scientists. I was also a
founding member of the MIT [Biological Engineering REFS](http://berefs.com/),
a peer-to-peer conflict management and mentoring program, and a Diversity
Chair on the department's graduate student board.  During my postdoc I served
as the President of the [Harvard Chan Postdoc
Association](http://hsph.me/pda) and served on the School's Committee for
Diversity and Inclusion.

## Other interests

I'm interested in how to optimally deliver technical information. I like the
idea of using [rules for games](/games) as a test case, but this is far from
optimized.

I produced [this list](https://github.com/swo/modern-greek-flashcards) of
Modern Greek vocabulary that might be useful to learners.

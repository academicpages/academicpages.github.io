Welcome! I’m **Momina Ali**, a computational scientist dedicated to developing intelligent, data-driven solutions that drive innovation in **bioinformatics**, **medical imaging**, and **virtual reality applications**. My work lies at the intersection of computational science and human-centered design, where I strive to address critical challenges in modern healthcare and education through advanced computing.

I specialize in harnessing the power of biological data, immersive technologies, and machine learning to explore complex research questions and create practical tools that make a difference. From genomic sequence analysis to diagnostic imaging and virtual training environments, my portfolio spans a diverse range of projects aimed at improving healthcare outcomes and advancing scientific understanding.

A key highlight of my work includes the development of a **virtual reality application** that enables users to interact with digital medical devices using intuitive **hand gestures**, creating more **natural and immersive experiences** for education and simulation. This project reflects my broader vision — to design technologies that feel seamless, responsive, and human-centric.

Currently, my research focuses on:
- **Bioinformatics workflows** for analyzing high-throughput biological data
- **AI-enhanced diagnostic models** in medical imaging
- **Augmented and virtual reality systems** for interactive learning and patient engagement
- **Multimodal data integration** for precision medicine

With a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience across both research and application domains, I’m committed to **bridging the gap between theoretical research and real-world impact**. I take pride in producing work that is technically sound, thoughtfully designed, and aligned with user needs in clinical, academic, and industry settings.

Beyond the lab, I’m deeply passionate about **collaboration**, **open science**, and **mentorship**. I actively seek opportunities to work with fellow researchers, healthcare professionals, and innovators to build solutions that matter. Whether it's co-authoring a paper, co-developing a prototype, or brainstorming a new interdisciplinary project — I welcome meaningful engagement.

I am B.K. Parida, an ardent and accomplished researcher with a comprehensive academic background spanning the domains of physics and artificial intelligence. My academic journey is underscored by a rigorous pursuit of knowledge, culminating in an M.Sc. degree in Physics with a specialization in astrophysics from the prestigious Pondicherry Central University, India. During my master's program, I had the privilege of serving as a research intern at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, an invaluable experience that significantly contributed to my research acumen.

Presently, I am deeply engrossed in the pursuit of a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in Artificial Intelligence at Sun Moon University, South Korea. My scholarly trajectory has been distinguished by an interdisciplinary orientation, bridging the chasm between theoretical physics, computational physics, and astrophysics.

Within the domain of theoretical physics, my focal areas of investigation have centered on Koopman-von Neumann Mechanics and the intricacies of the Eisenhart lift technique. These domains have enabled me to delve into the fundamental principles governing the behavior of physical systems.

In the realm of astrophysics, my research pursuits are concentrated upon modeling and conducting tidal deformation analyses of compact astrophysical objects, including Neutron Stars, Pulsars, Gravastars, Quark stars, and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Employing the general theory of relativity and modified gravity frameworks, I strive to decipher the enigmas and intricacies of these celestial phenomena.

My present doctoral research is at the confluence of artificial intelligence and computer vision, with a specific focus on 3D reconstruction from a single-view image. This niche area of research has the potential to redefine the frontiers of human perception and interaction with the digital world, providing an innovative dimension to my scientific endeavors.

Of profound interest to me is the fusion of deep learning techniques with the realms of theoretical physics and astrophysics. I aspire to usher in novel solutions to intricate problems, thereby augmenting our comprehension of the universe and the complexities that underlie it.

For a comprehensive overview of my scholarly contributions, I invite you to explore my list of publications on Google Scholar, a testament to my inquisitive journey in the scientific world. I am resolute in my commitment to advancing the frontiers of knowledge and eagerly anticipate opportunities for collaborative exploration with kindred scientific minds.

<b>About the lab</b>

The Flanagan Lab in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch is focused on understanding the evolution of complex, multivariate traits (especially sexually dimorphic traits), primarily relying on population and quantitative genetics, genomic datasets, simulation modeling. Our empirical work has mostly focused on pipefish and seahorses.


<b>Lab news</b>

March 2021: Sarah has published a paper on [the genetic basis of freshwater adaptation in pipefish](https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/doi/10.1111/mec.15841). 

November 2020: Nicole Tosto began her PhD studying pipefish behaviour and genetics! She is currently working with collaborators in the US and plans to join the group in New Zealand in 2021.

March 2020: Sarah had three papers come out this month -- a paper on [changes in gene expression in response to estrogen in pipefish](https://doi-org.ezproxy.canterbury.ac.nz/10.1093/jhered/esaa008), a paper on [a mathematical model of how spatial arrangements of individuals impacts reproductive success](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1438-390X.12047) and a whitepaper describing [the why, when, and how of computing in biology classrooms](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.20873.2).

February 2020: Lucy Howell joined the lab as a Masters in Antarctic Studies student! 

Check out how Sarah spent her time in 2019 [in her latest blog post!](https://sarahpflanagan.wordpress.com/?p=1932)

November 2019: Sarah was awarded a [Marsden Award](https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/news/world-class-research-supported-by-marsden-fund-including-two-large-marsden-interdisciplinary-awards/) to conduct research on the evolution of sex-biased gene expression in pipefish, in collaboration with [Bob Wong](http://www.bobwonglab.org/) (Monash University) and [Judith Mank](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/mank-lab/) (University of British Columbia)! 

November 2019: Sarah received an Early Career Researcher Seed Grant from the [New Zealand Antarctic Research Institute](https://nzari.aq/)! The project is focused on developing environmental DNA sequencing protocols that can be used in Antarctica.

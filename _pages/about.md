Welcome to [Zeju Li (李泽钜)](https:/staymylove.github.io/) 's homepage!

I'm a Junior student at Communication Engineering Elite Class in Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BPUT), I am in the National Engineering Research Center of Mobile Network Security in BUPT as a research intern, supervised by [Prof. Guoshun Nan (南国顺)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uSykWkMAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests include Data mining, Semantic communication and Multimodality.


<!-- Before starting my Ph.D. career, I was a research intern at [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/), supervised by [Prof. Hui Xiong](http://datamining.rutgers.edu/) and collaborate with Baidu Talent Intelligence Center, supervised by [Dr. Hengshu Zhu](https://www.zhuhengshu.com/). Moreover, I was a research intern at DKI Group, [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.msra.cn/) supervised by [Dr. Shizhao Sun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E8%AF%97%E6%98%AD-%E5%AD%99-771b42141/), and a research assistant at [HIT-DBLab](http://db.hit.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Hongzhi Wang](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wang). I also did research with [Prof. Jia Li](https://sites.google.com/view/lijia) and [Dr. Yu Rong](https://hk.linkedin.com/in/royrong). -->

Here is my latest [curriculum vitae](https://staymylove.github.io/cv/).

I am a doctoral candidate in Economics at the **University of Massachusetts Amherst**, working at the intersection of **political economy, economic history, history of economic thought, and macroeconomics**.  

My research investigates how **institutions, technology, and distribution co-determine the long-run dynamics of capitalist development and state formation**. Drawing on comparative political economy and historical analysis, I study how accumulation and crisis evolve under structural imbalance—when the conversion of investment into productive capacity depends on shifting institutional and distributive configurations.  

The dissertation develops this framework through a comparative analysis of **Chile and the United States** across the Fordist and post-Fordist eras, combining formal modeling, historical reconstruction, and econometric estimation.  

Building on this foundation, my current work extends the analysis to **the political economy of law and restorative justice**, exploring how legal and administrative systems sustain coercive power beyond regime change. 

Together, these projects aim to explain how capitalist and state dynamics intertwine—how economies accumulate, institutions adapt, and power reproduces itself—across the economic and juridical architectures of modern societies.  
Future research will broaden this comparative horizon to other **Southern Cone economies**, tracing the historical and institutional diversity of Latin American development paths.


## Dissertation Research

My dissertation, *Essays on Chile and the United States in Comparative–Relational Perspective*, develops a **demand-led, comparative political economy of capitalist development** across the Fordist era. It formalizes how capacity utilization, income distribution, and institutionally conditioned technological change, co-evolve to shape accumulation and crisis. Assuming that elasticity of productive capacities to accumulatioin of capital is not one, the link between accumulation and productive capacities becomes unbalanced, configurating distinct **regimes of instability** — stagnation tendencies, cyclical crises, and accumulation-regime breakdowns that require institutional and technological reconfiguration without necessarily finding one. 

The project combines **theoretical modeling, historical reconstruction, and econometric estimation**. It builds center-periphery–consistent measures of capital productivity and utilization; estimates profitability decompositions for the United States and Chile; and re-visits the debate on the rise and fall of the **Unidad Popular**, the socialist coalition led by Salvador Allende during the 1970-1973. Understanding the revolutionary period of Chielean history as a critical juncture of world history amidst the global transition from Fordism to post-Fordism, shaped by external constraint and domestic class conflict, the dissertation advances a relational center-periphery of capitalist dynamics, connecting macroeconomic instability to the historical transformation of accumulation regimes.

## New Projects

Alongside my dissertation, I am developing a second research line on **Restorative Justice and the Political Economy of Law**, focused on how coercive institutions reproduce power through legality. It examines how legal and administrative systems preserve coercive power beyond formal regime change, focusing on the **repressive apparatus of the Chilean dictatorship and its institutional afterlives**.  Rather than treating repression as a deviation from legality, this research conceives the legal order itself as a **material infrastructure of coercion and hierarchy**—a mechanism through which the State organizes knowledge, distributes responsibility, and reproduces authority.

Using web-scrapping of digitalized archives, and network analysis, I map the civil–military circuits that enabled surveillance, disappearance, and impunity, tracing how these forms of control persisted within democratic institutions. The project approaches accountability as a **structural property of power**, not only a moral demand or post-conflict procedure.  
By linking the topology of repression to the architecture of law, it seeks to clarify how a society’s institutional memory can either sustain or dismantle the conditions that made systematic violence possible.

## Ongoing projects

- *Demand and Accumulation in Long-Run Capitalist Development: Unbalanced Growth and
Crisis* — Job Market Paper  
  + Develops a formal model of capitalist accumulation under persistent technological imbalance, integrating classical and post-Keynesian traditions to show how the feedback of capital accumulation into economic capacities creation determines dynamic stability in the long run.
  + Identifies crisis as an endogenous regime outcome, demonstrating how persistent unbalanced growth and accumulation-demand dynamics generate distinct domains of instability, providing a taxonomy distinguishing stagnation, partial crisis, and regime crisis.

- *The Ideological Embeddedness of Macroeconomic Indexes* — Paper Submited for Review.
  + Traces how U.S. capacity-utilization metrics shifted from a Keynesian tool to mobilize slack under Fordism to an inflation sentinel in the 1970s, showing that utilization measures were institutionally constructed in symbiotic interest of _Monopoly Capital_ and the State.
  + Reframes American Keynesianism as government-by-numbers, documenting how survey-based indices crowded out physical measures (EMU, AWW), and argues for plural, transparent indicators to reopen the policy dashboard to democratic contestation amid neoliberal technocratic closure.

- *Reconstructing Capital Stocks for Chile, 1901–1994* — Dataset & Methods Paper.
  + Reconstructs Chile’s gross and net capital stocks (1901–1994) in a stock–flow consistent framework, harmonizing Hofman, Clio-Lab, Díaz–Wagner, Tafunell–Ducoing, and Pérez-Eyzaguirre to deliver sectoral series plus implicit δ (depreciation) and z (depletion).
  + Establishes a reproducible baseline for profitability and capacity studies, validating identities and documenting sectoral patterns: durable ME with negative δ episodes, rising RC depreciation, and restructuring-era spikes consistent with scrappage and modernization.

A complete list of my publications, working papers, and talks is available on the **[Research](/publications)** and **[Talks](/talks)** pages.

## Teaching and Mentorship

I have taught or assisted at **UMass Amherst**, **Wesleyan University**, **Amherst College**, **Universidad de Santiago de Chile**, and **Universidad de Chile**, covering topics from *Macroeconomics* and *Economic Development* to *Political Economy of Latin America*.  

I mentor undergraduate and graduate theses on issues such as corruption, gender equity, and distributive conflict, with advisees later entering programs at **Columbia**, **Fordham**, and **USACH**.

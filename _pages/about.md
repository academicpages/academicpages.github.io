Welcome! I am currently a forth-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science, Emory University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. [Liang Zhao](https://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/). Previously, I received my master's degree in Statistics from George Washington University in 2020. I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the [School of Mathematical Science, Fudan University](https://math.fudan.edu.cn/) in Shanghai, China in 2018. 

Research
======
I am generally interested in **designing efficient, generalizable, and explainable learning algorithms with theoretical guarantees**. Specifically, my current research topics include but are not limited to 1. Designing various learning strategies for more advanced and human-like AI, such as multi-task learning (MTL), continual learning, and domain generalization (DG). 2. Developing large-scale optimization algorithms with better scalability and performance, such as distributed parallel training for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and gradient-free optimization via e.g., alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), etc.

Under Construction!!!&#128679;

* I will update this website by late August&#128583;.

Hi there! I'm a research student in [the Department of Mathematical and Computing Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/is/eng/) at the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/organization/schools/organization04) in Japan (*Please note that the university will be renamed [the Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en) on October 1, 2024). Before joining Tokyo Tech, I majored in History and Philosophy of Science and minored in Computer Science at [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/). I'm currently studying a program analysis technique (AAMs) for programs with effect handlers. I'm applying to graduate programs in computer science for the 2025 cycle. Here is my CV (This is an [old version](http://yudaiurabe.github.io/files/20241106YudaiUrabe_CV.pdf). I will upload a new one soon!).



   I would love to study various subtopics in graduate school: program analysis, type systems, compiler design, automata theory, and program semantics

I completed my Master of Engineering (Mechanical) at the University of Melbourne in 2016. In 2015 I worked as a research assistant in the Fluid Dynamics lab at Melbourne before completing an exchange semester at ETH Zurich.
My final year Master's thesis was a combined project with the University of Melbourne and The Northern Hospital, performing computational fluid dynamics studies on patient-specific coronary arteries under the supervision of <a href="https://mechanical.eng.unimelb.edu.au/people/a-ooi" target="_blank">Andrew Ooi</a>.

In 2017 I commenced my PhD in Robotic Vision under the supervision of <a href="https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/robert-mahony" target="_blank">Rob Mahony</a> and <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~nmb/" target="_blank">Nick Barnes</a> at the ANU.
My PhD topic is the development of novel optical flow algorithms capable of running in real-time for high-speed robotics applications.
I am currently pursuing this research using event cameras, which are bio-inspired vision sensors with microsecond temporal resolution.

In 2018 I moved to Zurich for a 12 month research visit at the University of Zurich, <a href="http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/" target="_blank">Robotics and Perception Group</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html" target="_blank">Davide Scaramuzza</a>.
Here I will research image reconstruction, optical flow and deep learning with event cameras.

When I'm not doing research I enjoy playing underwater rugby!

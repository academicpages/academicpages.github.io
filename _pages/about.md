I am an assistant teaching professor in the electrical and computer engineering department at UC Davis. I am broadly interested in algorithmic aspects of data science and on learning and reasoning under constraints on computational resources like memory, precision, and network communication. I am particularly interested in exploiting randomness to develop algorithms that have formal guarantees of correctness while lending themselves to realization in highly-parallel and noisy hardware.

Prior to joining UC Davis, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley. I received my PhD in Computer Science from UC San Diego in September 2023, where I was supervised by Sanjoy Dasgupta and Tajana Rosing. I received my Bachelor of Science, with high honors, in Agricultural Economics from the University of California, Berkeley in 2013 and previously worked as a Senior Research Analyst at Brown University for Justine Hastings and Jesse Shapiro.

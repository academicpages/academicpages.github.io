I am currently doing a PhD in Machine Learning at the Alan Turing Institute (with UCL), supervised by Prof. Mirco Musolesi and Prof. Steve Hailes.

I graduated from The University of Edinburgh with a BSc in Computational Cognitive Science in 2016 and then from University College London with an MSc in Data Science and Machine Learning in 2017.

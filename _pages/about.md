Hi! I am a third-year doctoral student in [School of Information](https://ischool.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/).  I have a background in data and learning sciences. My research interests are primarily focused on human-centered computing and critical data studies. I draw on theories of epistemic oppression (Dr. Kristie Dotson), resistance (Dr. José Medina), and decolonizing practices (Dr. Linda Tuhiwai Smith) in my research. I am currently studying social, cultural, and political components of data-informed processes and technologies. To do this work, I take an interpretivist lens and use ethnography (observations, interviews, narratives) and data science methods. 

<!-- I am advised by Dr. [Angela Smith](https://angeladrsmith.com/). I am currently studying how we might approach, understand, and respond to faith- and gender-based oppression in digital spaces and reimagine the design of digital spaces to encourage virtuous habits in online communities. -->

I am currently advised by Dr. [Angela Smith](https://angeladrsmith.com/). I completed my B.Eng. in Information Technology from University of Mumbai, followed by M.S. in Data Science and M.Ed. in Learning Sciences with generous funding from [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/) School of Education. At Indiana University, I have worked with and been mentored by Drs. [Rebecca Neri](https://ucla.academia.edu/RebeccaNeri), [Norman Su](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~normsu/), and [Phoebe Wakhungu](https://education.indiana.edu/about/directory/profiles/wakhungu-phoebe.html). In this work, I was applying data science skills in higher education, writing about datafication in classroooms, and learning about human-centered design. 


Below is an up-to-date list of my co-authored publications.

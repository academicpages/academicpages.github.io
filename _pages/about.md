I am an applied mathematician, building bridges
between the mathematical, computational, and biological sciences.  My
strong foundations in each, allow me to identify key biological problems, draw
on and contribute to theoretical mathematical foundations, and develop
advanced computational tools.

Swarms, flocks, and human societies all exhibit complex collective
behaviours. I am interested in collective cell behaviours, which I view as
swarms with a twist: (1) cells are not simply point-like particles but have
spatial extent, (2) interactions between cells go beyond simple
attraction-repulsion, and (3) cells ``live'' in a regime where friction
dominates over inertia. Examples include: wound
healing, embryogenesis (normal development),
the immune response, and cancer
metastasis. I use mathematical modelling and computational biology to uncover
the *universal principles*
how biological, physical, and chemical factors shape biological tissues.

Interactions in tissues range over several orders of magnitude in time and
spatial scales.  Distinct mathematical frameworks are appropriate for specific
levels of detail. For instance, differential equations (DEs), tracking changes in cell
(or protein) densities, are suitable for describing large populations. I use
**dynamical systems, bifurcation theory**, and **group theory** to
analyse **nonlocal** DEs. On the other hand, to track the motion, behaviour,
or forces produced by individual cells, a more detailed **cell-based
computational framework** is needed. I refer to such models as cell-based models
(CBMs).

## About me

I am a third-year direct Ph.D. student at the **College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/)**. My research interests lie in **robotic tactile perception** and its **methods and applications in agricultural scenarios**, with an emphasis on enabling robots to handle soft, fragile produce safely and intelligently.

My work sits at the intersection of **Computer Science (CS)**, **Electrical Engineering (EE)**, and **Agricultural Engineering (AE)**, combining sensing, robotics, and learning-based perception to support tasks such as quality-aware manipulation and automation in post-harvest systems.

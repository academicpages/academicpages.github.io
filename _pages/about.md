I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry (MPI-BPC)](https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/en) in  the group lead by [Dr. Juliane Liepe](https://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/15662258/cv_liepe).

At MPI, my work primarly involves building software pipelines and tools based on machine learning techniques for systematic analysis of large-scale mass-spectrometric data for quantification, prediction, and identification of peptides.

Before, I have completed my [doctorate](https://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/10523) from the University of Stuttgart worked in analysis of robustness in signaling networks under deterministic and stochastic environment under [Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Nicole Radde](https://www.ist.uni-stuttgart.de/de/institut/team/Radde-00007/)

Besides, being a computational and systems biologist, I am also a computer science engineer by my previous background.

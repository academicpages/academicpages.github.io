I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Cornell University, starting this fall.


Previously, I was a master's student in Mathematics, curriculum 'Stochastics and Data science' at the University of Turin and a [Senior Allievo at Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/education/allievi-honors-program/), where I was supervised by prof [Stefano Favaro](http://sites.carloalberto.org/favaro/). My master thesis was about *Bayesian Nonparametric cardinality estimation from Sketched Data*. 

I obtained my B.sc. in Statistics at the University of Bologna, where I was supervised by [Christian Hennig](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZG9XA4IAAAAJ&hl=en).

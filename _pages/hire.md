## Portfolio
My main projects can be found on my [resume](https://godsped.com/cv). Other things can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Samir-Rashid).

## Consulting
I focus on helping small/medium size business deployments. I can set up on-premise IT needs so your business can own its own data without any subscription fees or reliance on external vendors. Services include closed-circuit surveillance, website hosting and analytics, and redundant backups. I can also provide licensed security system installation and monitoring.

I am not currently looking for programming contract work.

## Philanthropy
If you have an old computer, I help refurbish and donate computers.

## Want to work with me?
Contact me through my information in the sidebar. Email is best. You can also email `me at this domain`.

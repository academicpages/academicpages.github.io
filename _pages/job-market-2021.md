  <details><summary>BIO</summary><p>I am a PhD student from the Department of Government at the University of Essex (UK). I am interested in the construction, enforcement and effects of state-based and international institutions that regulate multinational firms.
<br />
In my PhD thesis I focus on the multilateral cooperation to regulate corporate foreign bribery. I seek to explain variations in state capacity to hold corporations accountable for exporting corruption abroad. I approach my study employing quantitative methods, and bringing together insights from the literature on international institutions and on political-economic determinants of firms' behaviors.</p>

I am interested in political economy, comparative politics and quantitative methods. My research examines current threats to the legitimacy of the state. In my dissertation and book project, I study how criminal organizations are expanding to the richest countries in the world and the consequences of this infiltration on politics. Strong states face important challenges in the management of migration. I ask what causes clashes between natives and migrants and how these fractures can be healed and integration policies be promoted without backlash.</p>

My research also adopts an interdisciplinary approach, contributing to scholarship in international relations, and the study of international law and organizations, and international political economy (IPE) in particular.</p>

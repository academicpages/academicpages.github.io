  <details><summary>BIO</summary><p>I am a doctoral student at Brandeis University International Business School in Waltham, Massachusetts.  My research focuses on monetary economics and household saving behavior. In my JMP, I identify a seigniorage channel that biases the optimal inflation target for a currency hegemon upward.  I show this channel using a two-country heterogenous agent model with idiosyncratic income shocks and a single asset (fiat currency) produced by a monopolist, i.e. the currency hegemon.  By collecting an inflation tax from foreign households, this hegemon subsidizes a current account deficit and raises aggregate domestic welfare. These welfare gains come at the expense of the rest of the world.

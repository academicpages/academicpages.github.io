## Organization
* I organize the SDU Operator Algebras seminar together with [Alistair Miller](https://sites.google.com/view/alistair-miller/home?authuser=0).
* I am a co-organizer of the [NSeaG](https://sites.google.com/view/nseag/home) workshop 2024: [OdenSeaG](https://sites.google.com/view/odenseag2024/home).

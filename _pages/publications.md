### [On Masked Language Models for Contextual Link Prediction](https://aclanthology.org/2022.deelio-1.9.pdf)
In the real world, many relational facts require context; for instance, a politician holds a given elected position only for a particular timespan. [...]

Brayne, A., **Wiatrak, M.**, Corneil D.\
In ACL 2022 workshop on Deep Learning Inside Out (DeeLIO).

### [Directed graph embeddings in pseudo-riemannian manifolds](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/sim21a/sim21a.pdf)
The inductive biases of graph representation learning algorithms are often encoded in the background geometry of their embedding space. [...]

### [Simple hierarchical multi-task neural end-to-end entity linking for biomedical text](https://aclanthology.org/2020.louhi-1.2.pdf)
Recognising and linking entities is a crucial  first step to many tasks in biomedical text  analysis, such as relation extraction and target identification. [...]

### [Stabilizing generative adversarial networks: A survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00927.pdf)
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of generative model which have received much attention due to their ability to model complex real-world data. Despite their
recent successes, the process of training GANs remains challenging [...]

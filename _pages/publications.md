My current research often considers problems related to *Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra* (RandNLA).  This area can be regarded as a fusion between more theoretically oriented fields, such as random matrix theory and matrix perturbation theory, with the more practice-oriented field of numerical linear algebra.  This area thoroughly captures my goal of studying practical theory.  I spend my time learning about mathematically elegant results, such as establishing [matrix concentration inequalities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.01571.pdf) via the matrix Laplace transform, and then use the consequences of these results to develop new approaches to ubiquitous computational problems, such as linear optimization.

Prior to starting my PhD, I carried out research in the field of Health Informatics, working with researchers at Regenstrief Institute.  While doing so, I asked (and partially answered) questions related to the deployment of machine learning in healthcare.  This was an excellent experience, as it emphasized the systems-level challenges (e.g. data privacy, bureaucratic inertia, formatting standards) to effectively using the algorithms we develop to solve end-use problems.

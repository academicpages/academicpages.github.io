**Can Supply Shocks Facilitate Price Coordination? Evidence from the Airline Industry**

I conduct a descriptive analysis of the effects of the Boeing 737 MAX grounding on airline ticket prices. I show that prices increased significantly on affected routes using an differences-in-difference event study framework. The price increases are primarily driven by Southwest (the low cost carrier) while the remaining major airlines (AA, Delta, and United) reduced prices in response to the shock. I start by measuring the welfare effects of this supply shock by estimating demand. I will then focus on the conduct angle--can the rival airline prices increases be explained by Nash-Bertrand? I plan to use conduct tests à la Ciliberto and Williams (2014) to answer this question. Please see this [proposal]({{https://pranjal-drall.github.io}}/files/601_proposal.pdf) for more details.

*Previous Version:* This paper was originally written for Eric Ohrn's seminar in Microeconometrics at Grinnell under the title "Market Power in Airlines: Evidence from the Boeing 737 MAX Grounding" and it won the Midwest Economics Association's Best Undergraduate Paper Prize in 2020. This project has *substntially* changed since then.

**The Long Run Impact of Farm Foreclosures: Evidence from the Great Depression**

This project examines the impact of farm foreclosures during the Great Depression on individuals and land. I exploit the passage of state foreclosure moratorium laws between 1931-1933 which temporarily prevented creditors from foreclosing on delinquent farmers in 27 states. This allows me to compare counties with similar percent of farms mortgaged (and other pre-1930s baseline characteristics) across foreclosure regimes. Using linked Census microdata, I first show that preventing foreclosures improved earnings and reduced migration for individuals. The policy benefits both farm owners and (likely) tenant farmers. Although preventing foreclosures had a positive impact on individuals, I find that foreclosure moratoria caused large and persistent decreases in land values, revenues, and agricultural productivity at the county level. These effects are at least partially mediated by an increase in tenant share of farmland at the county level. In contrast, I also find that the moratoria caused significant decreases in manufacturing value added per worker, capital investment and productivity at the county level. Event study estimates suggest that relative declines in manufacturing output and productivity coincide with growth in American manufacturing (1960s onwards). I confirm the null effect immediately following the policy using the Biennial Census of Manufacturers for 1927-1937. Given the timing of these declines, I conjecture they are likely driven by misallocation of land and resources stemming from lower exposure to centralized auctions in counties where a greater number of foreclosures were prevented. These results highlight the long run costs associated with disallowing market mechanisms during times of economic distress.

**Racial and Gender Bias in Child Maltreatment Reporting Decisions: Results of a Randomized Vignette Experiment** (with Ian Ayres and Sonia Quinn)

In this randomized vignette experiment, we asked 4,000 respondents through a YouGov survey to decide how likely they would be to report potential instances of child maltreatment to authorities. We used racialized and gendered names to suggest randomize the identities of the parents and children that respondents viewed in each of the ten vignettes that were based on real-life eventsthey were shown. We find that respondents were less likely to report potential child maltreatment when the vignette used non-White names to describe the family participants. Respondents were less likely to report when a male child was involved, and more likely to report when a male parent was involved. The uncovered racial and gender were more pronounced in vignettes that were of intermediate severity.

**The Impact of Involuntary Outpatient Commitment Laws on Mental Health Outcomes** (with Ian Ayres)

In 1971, Florida passed the "Baker Act" which allows the involuntary institutionalization and examination of an individual by judges, law enforcement officials, physicians, or mental health professionals. Similar laws have been enacted in 43 states since then. These policy changes offer an opportunity to measure the impact of involuntary commitment on health outcomes, especially suicide and gun violence. AOT laws rely on a standard of dangerousness (although this varies by state) to commit individuals to outpatient facilities for a few days. This paper measures how the passage of these Involuntary Outpatient Commitment laws can impact the health outcomes especially suicide rates. We also utilize variation in mental health capacity within states to measure the heterogenous impacts of these laws.

**Trade Liberalization and Pollution: Evidence from the China Shock** [(Draft)]({{https://pranjal-drall.github.io}}/files/pollution.pdf)

This paper exploits an exogenous shock to import competition, the U.S. granting China Permanent National Trade Relations (PNTR) in 2000, to determine the effect of trade liberalization on industrial pollution. I find that increased geographic exposure to PNTR significantly reduced industrial pollution at the county level. A one unit standard deviation increase in exposure reduces PM2.5 concentration by 0.7 micrograms per cubic meter per year relative to counties that aren’t exposed. I find similar results for NO2 and SO2 concentration. These results confirm a classic prediction of trade models–that increased trade (import competition) reduces domestic pollution. They also help explain the decline in aggregate pollution from 1990-2015.

**The Impact of Replacement Stadiums on Property Values: A CPUMA Geographic Level Approach** (with Nola Agha) [(Draft)]({{https://pranjal-drall.github.io}}/files/stadiums.pdf)

Billions of dollars are spent annually constructing new facilities for professional sport teams. In recent years, a good portion of that spending is for facilities that replace existing facilities in the same city. This paper examines the role of new sporting facilities as local amenities that contribute to the value of housing prices. It investigates facilities opened between 2005 and 2017 in the top five professional leagues in the United States by utilizing a Consistent Public Use Microdata Area (CPUMA) to capture the local effect of a team and adjacent effects in bordering CPUMAs. It finds no significant effects of construction years or opening years on housing values in either the main or surrounding CPUMAs. The league for which the facility was built can be significantly positive or negative, with the effect changing depending on the specification.

This paper was written during my junior year at Grinnell. It was presented at the Western Economics Association International’s Conference (NAASE Session) in Tokyo (2019) and the Midwest Economics Association’s Annual Meetings (Undergrad Session) in St Louis (2019).

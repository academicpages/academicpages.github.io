  * Dissertation: *Interpretable Machine Learning and Applications*
  * Advisor: Prof. Dongxiao Zhu
* **B.S. in Financial Mathematics**, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), Shenzhen, China, 2011-2015

## Academic Appointments
* **Postdoctoral Research Associate**, Lucy Family Institute for Data & Society, University of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN (2024-Present)
  * Conducting research on computationally efficient and interpretable machine learning methods, explainability of large language models (LLMs), and their applications in social science and human behavior modeling
  * Collaborating with the IBM Technology Ethics Lab on responsible AI initiatives centered on explainability, fairness, and transparency in modern LLMs
  * Partnering with Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez (HIMFG) to advance medical record digitization and develop AI-assisted healthcare systems integrating Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) data

## Professional Experience
* **Applied Scientist**, AntGroup Inc., Shanghai, China (2022-2023)
  * Contributed to the development of the Ant Model Risk Evaluation system for assessing robustness, fairness, and explainability of machine learning models
  * Contributed to the design and development of large-scale security solutions for the Alipay ecosystem, including anti-cheating algorithms for online transactions, a robust risk detection system with interpretable risk indicators, and algorithms for detecting and mitigating malicious accounts across hundreds of millions of users and transactions

* **Data Mining Engineer Intern**, Quicken Loans Inc., Detroit, MI (2018)
  * Worked on client retention prediction using data-driven risk analysis models

* **Intern**, China Minsheng Bank, Shenzhen, China (2014)

## Research Projects
* **Principled LLM Reasoning Alignment with Explainable AI Techniques** (Ongoing)
  * Utilizing principled and theory-grounded explainable AI methods to align the verbal reasoning of large language models (LLMs), enhancing the fidelity of explanations and mitigating hallucinations

* **AI for Accessible and Equitable Healthcare** (Ongoing)
  * Collaborating with Hospital Infantil de México Federico Gómez (HIMFG) to digitize medical records and integrate Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) data, leveraging agentic AI to promote accessible and equitable healthcare delivery

## Grant Proposals and Funding Activities
* **NIH R21/R33 (Under Review)**, 2025
  * Co-author, contributed to technical sections on large language model (LLM)-based AI assistants and knowledge distillation for healthcare applications
  * PI: Prof. Nitesh Chawla, University of Notre Dame

* **NSF Proposal – LLM Reasoning Alignment with Principled Explainable AI (In Preparation)**, 2025
  * Co-author, contributing to proposal design and technical framework development

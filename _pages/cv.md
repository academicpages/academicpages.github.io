Research experiences
======
* Oct. 2018 - Present: Peking University (Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences) <br>
  Supervised by Jun Yang, Assistant Professor (Peking University) and Cheng Li, 51 peg b fellow (University of California, Berkeley)
  **Saturn's Temperature Profile: Simulation with 3D Cloud Resolving Model**
  * Studying Saturn's Temperature Profile based on SNAP model, modifying the original Jupiter model to apply to Saturn.
  * The results suggests that Saturn's interior is warmer than what people previously thought and that the effect of molecule weight must be included in a Jovian atmosphere general circulation model.
  * Determining the effect of condensable species density and longwave radiation cooling rate on the temperature profile.

* Feb. 2020 - Present: Peking University (Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences) <br>
  Supervised by Jun Yang, Assistant Professor (Peking University)
  **Clouds on Tidally-Locked Planets: 2D Cloud Resolving Simulation**
  * Studying the atmospheric circulation and cloud distribution of a tidally-locked planets using a 2D Erath-like version of SNAP model.
  * Demonstrating that the fixed SST forcing (equivalent to short-wave incoming) can stimulate strong convection near the sub-stellar point and thus reflect the radiation from the star, so that the inner boundary of Habitable Zone (HZ) for tidally-locked planets may be closer to the star.
  * Determining how the clouds distribution varies with different average SST, SST gradient and long-wave cooling rate.

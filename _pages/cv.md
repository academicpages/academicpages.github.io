Education
======
* B.S., Plant Science, Specialization in Research, Rutgers University, May 2010
  * Advisors: Drs. Richard Merritt, Gojko Jelenkovic
  * Graduated summa cum laude
* Ph.D., Agronomy, Specialization in Plant Breeding and Genetics, University of Nebraska - Lincoln, August 2017
  * Dissertation: "Dissecting the genetic architecture of salinity responses in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>)".
  * Advisor: Dr. Harkamal Walia
  * Committee: Drs. Paul Staswick, Chi Zhang, and Gautam Sarath

Research Experience
======
* September 2017 - Current: Postdoctoral Researcher
  * Department of Animal Science, University of Nebraska - Lincoln
  * Supervisor: Gota Morota
  * Currently, I am developing methods for genomic prediction and GWAS of longitudinal traits derived from high-throughput phenotyping platforms.
  
* March 2013 - August 2017: Graduate Research Assistant (Ph.D.)
  * Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, University of Nebraska - Lincoln
  * Supervisor: Harkamal Walia
  * The primary goal of my research was to examine the genetic basis of salinity tolerance in rice using a multidimensional approach that combined phenomics, transcriptomics, molecular biology, and genetics.

* September 2011 - March 2013: Graduate Research Assistant (M.S.)
  * Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, University of Nebraska - Lincoln
  * Supervisor: Harkamal Walia
  * My research was focused on elucidating the physiological and genetic basis of adaptation to drought and submergence in wheat and maize, respectively.
  
* September 2009 - August 2011: Undergraduate Research Assistant
  * Department of Plant Science, Rutgers University
  * Under the supervision of Dr. Richard Merritt, I assisted in the development of a bioreactor system for micropropagation of <i>Lilium spp.</i>. This system was intended to have applications in the horticulture and nutraceutical industries. Moreover, I worked with Dr. Gojko Jelenkovic in the evaluation and propagation of strawberry varieties.
  
* June 2010 - July 2010: Summer Intern 
  * USDA-ARS Tropical Agriculture Research Station, Mayaguez, PR
  * During the six-week internship I assisted with daily tasks in the entomology, dry bean genetics, and tropical fruit production groups.

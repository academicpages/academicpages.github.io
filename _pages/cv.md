### CURRENT POSITION

I am currently working as a Research Fellow in the [Meel group](https://meelgroup.github.io) at the [School of Computing (SoC)](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg) of the National University of Singapore (NUS), where I have been since February 2022. I work on certification & verification, MaxSAT, and propositional model counting (#SAT).

### DOCTORATE DEGREE

I did my doctorate research at the [Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science](https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/) (LIACS) of [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en), under supervision of [prof. dr. Joost Kok](http://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~kokjn/) (promotor), [prof. dr. Holger Hoos](http://ada.liacs.nl/members/#Holger) (promotor) and [ dr. Siegfried Nijssen](https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~snijssen/) (co-promotor / daily advisor). During the entire period as a doctorate student, I was also a visiting researcher at the [ICTEAM](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/icteam) of [Université catholique de Louvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html), where I spent the first year of my PhD (2017). I worked with  [prof. dr. Fahiem Bacchus](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fbacchus/) from the [Knowledge Representation group](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/kr/) at the University of Toronto, while I was a visiting researcher there from June to October of 2019.

The project I was hired on is called [PROFIDDS](http://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~nijssensgr/profidds/) (PRObabilistic Features for Intelligent Declarative Data Science), and was financed by an NWO TOP Grant, awarded to dr. Siegfried Nijssen.

My dissertation, [Optimal decision-making under constraints and uncertainty](https://hdl.handle.net/1887/3455662), was accepted in March 2022. I defended it on 13 September 2022 and received my doctorate degree on that day.

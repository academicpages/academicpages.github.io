# Research experience

**Alm lab**, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (2014-2019)   
*Under the direction of Eric Alm*

I did my PhD in [Eric Alm's lab](http://almlab.mit.edu/) at MIT.
You can learn more about my research interests on our [lab website](http://almlab.mit.edu/claire_duvallet.html) and on my [publications](/publications/) and [research](/research/) pages.
You can download my [thesis](https://www.dropbox.com/s/elvp8qzrz3zsjyx/duvallet_thesis_final.pdf?dl=0) and [defense slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j4b11wa8a4r42j8/2019-01-11.defense.pdf?dl=0), and also view them on my [github](https://github.com/cduvallet/phd-thesis).

**Molecular and Microscale Bioengineering Laboratory**, Columbia University (2011-2013)
*Under the direction of Samuel K. Sia*

I was an undergraduate research assistant in [Sam Sia](http://bme.columbia.edu/samuel-k-sia)'s lab for two years at Columbia.
There, I worked on developing a point-of-care microfluidic device to diagnose multi-drug resistant tuberculosis.
I primarily focused on the DNA amplification and detection modules, optimizing primers and reaction conditions off-chip.

**Laboratoire de Biochimie**, Ecole Polytechnique (Summer 2012)   
*Under the direction of Cedric Norais*

I was an international undergraduate research intern at Ecole Polytechnique the summer before my senior year.
There, I worked with Cedric Norais to study the acquired-immunity CRISPR system in E. coli.

# Teaching

## Academic

**20.106 Systems Microbiology, Teaching assistant**   
*Massachusetts Institute of Technology*, Cambridge, Massachusetts (Fall 2015)

I was a TA for seven advanced undergraduate students in a new course on the human microbiome, emerging disease, phylogenetics, and host-microbe interactions.
I developed problem sets and guided lecture content for a module on processing and analyzing 16S data, and facilitated and participated in paper discussions on various topics in zoonotic disease, viral communities, host immune responses, and the human microbiome.

**UP Biomedical Equipment Technology Department, Lecturer**   
*Engineering World Health and University of Puthisastra*, Phnom Penh, Cambodia (2013-2014)

During my Luce Year, I worked as a lecturer for [Engineering World Health](ewh.org) at the [University of Puthisastra](http://www.puthisastra.edu.kh/).
I developed curricula for anatomy and physiology, troubleshooting skills, and math in the new Associate Bachelor's program in Biomedical Equipment Technology.
I prepared and delivered lectures, exams, assignments, in-class activities, and demos for two classes of 12-18 Cambodian students and technicians (in English, with a translator).
I also managed Cambodian student-teaching staff during my main supervisor's absence and supported foreign and local teaching staff.

**The Art of Engineering, Teaching assistant**    
*Columbia University*, New York, NY (2012-2013)

My senior year at Columbia, I TAed the intro to engineering course for first year undergrads.
I assisted the students in designing and building a vital-signs monitoring device, guiding them through the engineering design process and teaching concepts in MATLAB and circuitry required for projects.
I also mentored and advised students on general biomedical engineering and college-related questions.

Projects
======
* <a href="https://github.com/hmmartiny/Predicting-Gene-Expression" target="_blank">Deep protein representations enable recombinant protein expression</a> (2019-2021): Originally my Master thesis project, where the goal was to predict recombinant gene expression using deep learning methods. After I finished in 2019, we wrote the findings into a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476927121001663" target="_blank">paper that has been published in Computational Biology and Chemistry</a>.
* <a href="https://github.com/mari756h/The_unemployed_cells" targeT="_blank">The Language of Life</a> (2018-2019): applying deep learning methods to predict amino acids in protein sequences. Project originally started as part of the course <a href="https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02456" target="_blank">02456 Deep Learning</a> at DTU. Applied Word2Vec and CNNs to protein sequence data.
* <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark">iGEM 2018: Hyphae Hackers, DTU Biobuilders.</a> Participated in 2018 as part of the team at TechnicalUniversity of Denmark. The project investigated how we can use mycelium from fungi as building materials, where I personally worked on <a href="http://2018.igem.org/Team:DTU-Denmark/GrowthModelling" targeT="_blank">modelling of hyphal growth</a>, and was part of the design team for the webpage.
* <a href="https://github.com/hmmartiny/Microbesoft" targeT="_blank">Microbesoft</a> (2018): a command-line tool to visualize alignment files. The project was built as part of participation in Copenhacks 2018, a hackathon held in Copenhagen for students, where our team won 2nd place.

Hobbies
======
I do like to draw and paint in my spare time, but more recently, I have taken up crochet - a good way to keep my supplies of dishcloths up to date.. I sometimes post my art at Instagram under the user <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hmmartiny/" targeT="_blank">hmmartiny</a>.

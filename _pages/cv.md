## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

### Research Experience

- **University of California, Berkeley**, Berkeley, California \
  *Ph.D. Student, Environmental Engineering* \
  August 01, 2022 --

  - Currently, I am a Ph.D. working with Professor Tina Chow to develop data assimilation applications for high-resolution wildfire smoke models.

&nbsp;

- **San Francisco Estuary Institute**, Richmond, California \
  *Environmental Analyst* \
  September 01, 2020 -- December 01, 2022

  - Developed biogeochemical + hydrodynamic numerical models to inform management decisions for the greater Bay Area. Work involved data processing, model set-up, model post-processing, and advancing interpretive findings.

&nbsp;

- **Fulbright Fellow**, Technische Universiteit Delft, the Netherlands \
  *Researcher in river morphology* \
  September 01, 2019 -- June 01, 2020

  - Worked in collaboration with Rijkwaterstaat (Dutch water ministry) and TU Delft to quantify morphological change from fixed river beds in the Waal. This involved the conversion and geospatial processing of various multibeam & single-beam bathymetric datasets.

&nbsp;

- **Deltares**, Delft, the Netherlands \
  *Rivers Department* \
  June 15, 2018 -- September 15, 2018

  - Processed bathymetry data from various sources and experimented with methodologies for parametrizing bedform drag in the hopes of improving physically-based roughness predictors for the Rijn River hydrological model.

&nbsp;

- **Environmental Fluid Mechanics Lab**, Stanford, California \
  *Sediment transport research* \
  May 01, 2016 -- September 01, 2019

  - Performed statistical analysis of sedimentation budgets for San Francisco Bay. Organized fieldwork in San Francisco Bay and calibrated/operated various instruments, including ADVs, ADCPs, RBRs, and thermistors.
  - Supervisors: Oliver Fringer and Joe Adelson

## Education

**Stanford University**, Stanford, California  
*September 2015 -- June 2019*

- B.S. with Honors in Environmental Engineering

  - Focus: environmental fluid mechanics, computational fluid dynamics, sustainability, mathematics
  
  - Completed over six masters courses in the environmental fluid mechanics masters track
  
  - Thesis: A Numerical Model for Sediment Flux and Floccation in San Francisco Bay. Ran a coupled hydrodynamic + sediment model (DFlow-FM + DELWAQ) to calculate sediment transport pathways and budgets in South San Francisco Bay.


## Skills

Python (incl. geospatial analysis packages), MATLAB, QGIS, numerical hydraulic modelling (incl. DFlow-FM, DELWAQ), LINUX/UNIX systems, GIT/version control, UAV pilot license, technical + long-form writing

Research experience
======
Department of Neurological Surgery, UCSF (Oct 2015 – present). Advisor Dr. Joseph Costello.
•	Identification of tumor –associated neoantigens in low-grade glioma in collaboration with Dr. Hideho Okada, UCSF. NCI-funded P01 project.
•	Design of a targeted glioblastoma screen for TERT-interacting proteins in vivo. Collaboration with Dr. Jennifer Doudna, UC Berkeley. 
•	Demonstrated the presence of novel perivascular cancer-associated fibroblasts in glioma. Manuscript expected 2018 (first author).
•	Revealed a multiverse model of tumor evolution in IDH-mutated multicentric glioma, published in Neuro-oncology, 2017.
•	Discovery that mutant IDH1 can be lost during malignant progression. Published in PNAS 2017. R01-funded project.
•	Identification of the reversal of replicative immortality in TERT promoter-mutant glioblastoma by reduction of a GABP isoform. Manuscript under revisions (co-author).


Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds (Oct 2012 – Sept 2015). This work was funded through a Yorkshire Cancer Research fellowship. Advisors Dr. David Westhead and Dr. Susan Short. External advisor Dr. Sean Lawler, Harvard Medical School.
•	Prediction of prognosis and drug response using MicroRNAs in brain tumors. Two first author publications in Molecular Oncology 2014 and 2016.
•	Discovered that the close alignment of glioblastoma gene expression patterns to oligodendrocyte precursors results in poor outcome. First author publication in OncoScience, 2014.
•	Design and execution of an in vitro screen of microRNAs associated with survival and migration in glioblastoma. Manuscript in preparation (co-author).


Translational Genomics Unit, University of Leeds (2010-2015). Advisor Dr. Graham Taylor.
•	Next generation sequencing pipeline (bioinformatics and wet-lab) for the detection of copy number changes in patients with learning difficulties. Publication in Genomics, 2012. This resulted in a diagnostic service to the patients of Yorkshire, UK.
•	Detection of EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements in non-small cell lung cancer. This resulted in a diagnostic service to the patients of Yorkshire, UK.


Yorkshire Regional Genetics Laboratory and Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, St James’s University Hospital (2005-2010)
•	Bleomycin as an alternative to irradiation for the diagnosis of Ataxia Telangiectasia. This resulted in a diagnostic service to the patients of Yorkshire, UK.
•	Cytogenetic changes of Ewing’s Sarcoma cell lines in culture
Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds (2002-2004)
•	Identification of genes involved in arginine catabolism in Streptomyces coelicolor (2004). Advisor Dr. Simon Baumberg. Funded through a UK Medical Research Council Studentship.
•	Genetics of susceptibility to Leprosy- genetic linkage analysis using bioinformatics (2003). Advisor Dr. Marie-Anne Shaw.
•	Construction of promoter:reporter gene fusions in Caenorhabditis elegans. Publication in Genome Research (2002). Advisor Dr. Ian Hope.

Funding

Undergraduate Thesis
=====
* **Topic**: Geolocation Extraction of Twitter users
* **Guide**: [Dr. Graciela Gonzalez-Hernandez](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/bio/graciela-gonzalez-hernandez-ms-phd), [Dr. Arjun Magge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arjunmagge/)
* **Overview**: Non-availability of well annotated and balanced datasets is considered as one of the major hurdles in analysing and extracting meaningful information from health-related tweets. In the past few years, the importance of geolocation systems have increased in health care applications, advertisments, natural disaster management, etc. Herein, we present a system which makes use of the location metadata such as geo, place and profile tags; and make use of user tweets to predict the structured location of a given Twitter user. Our system is based on the previous systems Carmen and Pigeo, and we overcome some of the drawbacks present in these systems while retaining the advantages of these systems. Furthermore, we make use of FasTText and Transformer models to build a text classifier for classifying between states in a particular country. The dataset for the same is prepared by making use of Tweepy.

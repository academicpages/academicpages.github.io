- Research of 3D multimodal-LLM by injecting 3D scenes and objects
  - Abstract: This project proposes to combine the reasoning and dialogue capabilities of 3D visual perception models and Large Language Models (LLM) to achieve a universal multimodal-LLM for 3D
scenes. And we sovle the problem of unbalance of visual and language training. We align and fuse
the features of the text image pair with the segmented objects in the corresponding 3D scene at a
fine-grained level. After that, the features of the relative position relationship matrix between objects were obtained using the coordinates of each object in the scene. Finally, the language model is
injected with multimodal knowledge (features) as learnable visual tokens to be added to the language
tokens in the middle of each Transformer layer of the LLM to fine-tune and train the 3D multimodal
large model of this project.

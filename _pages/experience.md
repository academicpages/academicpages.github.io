## Assistant Researcher
### Microsoft Research Asia (Sep 2020 - Present)
Proposed a unified structure-aware pre-training architecture for generally structured tables
* Devised a novel bi-dimensional coordinate tree to encode both the spatial and hierarchical information in tables
* Adapted the attention strategy upon bi-tree distance, boost up&down stream accuray by reducing visible scopes
* Leveraged three pre-training objectives at progressive levels to capture representations of tokens, cells, and tables
* Built the first dedicated vocabulary in the table domain, to embed commonly used table tokens with higher accuracy
* Achieved state-of-the-art performance on all four data sets of a critical downstream task: cell type classification

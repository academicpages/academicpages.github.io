## Massachusetts Institute of Technology

- Teaching Assistant, 20.260/20.460 Comptationl Analysis: Biological Data, Spring 2022
    - Instructor: Prof. Douglas Lauffenburger and Prof. Forest White
    - Description: This course is aimed at meeting the following learning objectives:
        - To gain understanding of how to frame questions concerning aspired prediction and insight from computational analysis and modeling of "omic data" in biology
        - To gain familiarity with foundational aspects of probability, statistics, and linear algebra underlying algorithms commonly employed in "omic biology data" analysis
        - To gain practice in identifying and using appropriate computational algorithms for analyzing "omic biology data"
        - To gain capability in interpreting results from computational analysis of "omic biology data"
    - Responsibility:
        - Hold office hours
        - Grade homework assignments
        - Design and teach tutorial sessions on 1) Feature selection and 2) Classification using PLS-DA


## Brown University

- Teaching Assistant, ENGN0030 Introduction to Engineering, Fall 2017
    - Instructor: Prof. Karen Haberstroh and Prof. Brian Sheldon
    - Description: The purpose of the course is to introduce students to the profession of engineering and the important role engineers play in society, as well as to provide a foundation for further study in engineering. The course begins with the consideration of engineering design and introduces a number of tools that are fundamental to engineering. These include vectors, computer aided design (SolidWorks), and basic programming (MATLAB). Particular attention is then focused on the analysis of static structures, but topics also include professional ethics and the social responsibility of engineers. Students will complete a set of training modules and three design projects in the Brown Design Workshop.
    - Responsibility:
        - Hold 4-hr office hours per week
        - Grade homework assignments
        - Hold tutorial sessions on 1) MATLAB and 2) Introduction to vectors
        - Proctor mid-term and final exams
- Teaching Assistant, [ENGN0040 Dynamics and Vibrations](https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Courses/En4/), Spring 2018
    - Instructor: Prof. Allan Bower and Prof. Jimmy Xu
    - Description: A broad introduction to Newtonian dynamics of particles and rigid bodies with applications to engineering design. Concepts include kinematics and dynamics of particles and rigid bodies; conservation laws; vibrations of single degree of freedom systems; and use of MATLAB to solve equations of motion and optimize engineering designs. Examples of applications are taken from all engineering disciplines. Lectures, recitation, and team design projects, including use of Brown Design Workshop. Prerequisite: ENGN 0030.
    - Responsibility:
        - Hold 4-hr office hours per week
        - Grade homework assignments
        - Proctor four group projects
        - Proctor mid-term and final exams

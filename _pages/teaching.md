## Teaching Philosophy

Teaching undergraduate and graduate students from theoretical and practical perspectives fosters creative thinking and impactful learning. I teach students to solve real-world problems through theoretical knowledge, adequate exercise, and practical implementations. My academic experience as a student and a teacher helped me interact with students and adapt my teaching style to reflect a greater learning outcome through diversified teaching techniques. Students are at different intellectual phases and require different models of teaching facilities to encourage effective learning. Therefore, I ensure that the teaching environment is flexible, multi-modal, and accommodative to support diverse students to learn with efficacy to embody creativity. Effective learning requires developing appropriate learning evaluations and assessments. So, I assess students' abilities through homework assignments, quizzes, midterms, and labs. Moreover, students learn the fundamentals in class but need more practical experience when starting their industry careers. Therefore, I engage students in hands-on projects to solve real-world problems. Developing students to think critically with the fundamentals taught in class is one of my aims to prepare them to solve practical problems. I promote the amalgamation of knowledge, learning, comprehension and practice to foster students to reach new milestones in their career.

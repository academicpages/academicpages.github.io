## Learning Resources
[_**Tarangini**_](http://tarangini-sim.herokuapp.com/) is a web based listing of teaching simulations I have developed. It is a work in progress. Tarangini can be used as a companion to visualize concepts in Economics & Econometrics. Example of some simulations, developed using Python and Dash framework:
* Economic cost functions

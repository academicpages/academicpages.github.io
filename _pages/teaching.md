Guest lectured on <i>situational knowledge, knowledge graphs, and multimodal information retrieval</i>. Talked about cross correlation learning, metric learning, decoder-encoder networks, and attention networks. Taught about video feature extraction with YOLO, text feature extraction, graph embedding techniques, and graph matching. Also demonstrated a multimodal retrieval system with text, image, and video modalities.
- [CS54300: Intro. To Simulation & Modeling Of Computer Systems](https://sites.google.com/site/kmasolaiman/courses/spring2019/cs543), Spring 2019 (Assistant) <br>
Developed solutions to five programming assignments throughout the semester while working closely with the instructor. Programming assignments were designed for single server queue, tandem queue, and mutli-server queue.

# Teaching and Organizing:

I'm co-organizing the first [Tree shrew Meeting](https://mpfi.org/treeshrewmeeting/), to bring together neuroscientists using the tree shrew animal model. This virtual meeting will be followed by an in-person meeting in the future.

In the summer of 2020, I participated in [Neuromatch Academy](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/), a three week virtual computational neuroscience summer school, as an organizer and board member. NMA served 1700 students in 2020 and will reach many more through freely available [course material](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/syllabus). 

I've also been involved in the Cold Spring Harbor Summer School on [Neural Data Science](https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=c-neudata&year=19), as a TA in 2015 and 2017 and a co-instructor in 2019.

From 2013-2016 I had the very fun role of 'Science Fair Mentor' and Judge for Philadelphia 6th-8th graders. Prior to that, I worked for several years as an SAT tutor for high-school students.

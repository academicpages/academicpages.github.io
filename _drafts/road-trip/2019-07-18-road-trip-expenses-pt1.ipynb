    "Hm. This is also surprising, and tells me that I spent money on way more days than I thought. (I am seeing this in the fact that the \"0\" bar is quite large on all histograms, indicating that I frequently went zero days in between sequential purchases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, I bought food two days in a row about 40 times. And then the majority of the rest of the times I bought food were just 1 day apart. In other words, for the majority of my trip I bought food either every day or every other day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looks like the story is pretty similar for car-related expenses: the majority of expenses had a lag of 0-2 days. So for the majority of my trip, I spent money on my car somewhere between every day and every 3 days. That makes sense -- I usually moved to a new spot every 2-3 days, which entailed a lot of driving, and I must have gotten gas basically every time I did that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lodging. Let's see: does this make sense? My impression is that I super rarely paid for housing... What this is saying is that yes, there were a few times when I went a week or more without paying for housing, but when I did pay for housing I paid for housing again within the next three days. I have a separate spreadsheet where I tracked the lodging expenses more cleanly, we'll have to come back to this when we analyze that one...\n",

## Abstract

<p>We present ideas and concepts towards defining a common framework unifying abstract metrics in order to quantify key features of technical load-bearing structures and biological systems. Our aim is to transfer biological concepts to technical systems at this abstract level rather than on the basis of their outward appearance or actual functionality. This means that the biological concept generators for load-bearing structures do not have to be load-bearing structures themselves but may instead achieve rather different functionalities. We intend to carry out this transference by generalizing graph-based abstractions of both technical and biological worlds to allow comparisons to be made at an abstract level. We focus in particular on the intrinsically competing aims of optimality versus multi-functionality and robustness. In this review, we present initial attempts towards defining suitable quantitative measures for robustness to serve as a common ground for studying technical systems and biological systems simultaneously. We discuss generic properties of a ubiquitous signalling network motif and potential relationships to a minimal model for a robust truss structure. These case studies suggest that topological complexity can serve as a common source for a design that is insensitive to perturbations and thus robust in the measures of both worlds.</p>

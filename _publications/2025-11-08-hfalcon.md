excerpt: |
    As sentence-level performance in modern Machine Translation (MT) has plateaued,reliable document-level evaluation is increasingly needed.While the recent FALCON framework with pragmatic features offers a promising direction, its reliability and reproducibility are unclear.We address this gap through human evaluation,analyzing sources of low inter-annotator agreement and identifying key factors. Based on these findings,we introduce H-FALCON,a Human-centered refinement of FALCON. Our experiments show that, even with limited annotator consensus,H-FALCON achieves correlations comparable to or better than standard sentence-level protocols. Furthermore, we find that contextual information is inherent in all sentences, challenging the view that only some require it. This suggests that prior estimates such as “n% of sentences require context” may stem from methodological artifacts. At the same time,we show that while context is pervasive,not all of it directly influences human judgment.

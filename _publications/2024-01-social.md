**Abstract**: To mitigate the current COVID-19 pandemic, policy makers at the Greater London Authority, the regional governance body of London, UK, are reliant upon prompt, accurate and actionable estimations of lockdown and social distancing policy adherence. Transport for London, the local transportation department, reports they implemented over 700 interventions such as greater signage and expansion of pedestrian zoning at the height of the pandemic’s first wave with our platform providing key data for those decisions. Large well-defined heterogeneous compositions of pedestrian footfall and physical proximity are difficult to acquire, yet necessary to monitor city-wide activity (busyness) and consequently discern actionable policy decisions. To meet this challenge, we leverage our existing large-scale data processing urban air quality machine learning infrastructure to process over 900 camera feeds in near real-time to generate new estimates of social distancing adherence, group detection and camera stability. In this work, we describe our development and deployment of a computer vision and machine learning pipeline. It provides near immediate sampling and contextualization of activity and physical distancing on the streets of London via live traffic camera feeds. We introduce a platform for inspecting, calibrating and improving upon existing methods, describe the active deployment on real-time feeds and provide analysis over an 18 month period.

### Launching into Computing - Summary

<br>
<br>

## Learning Outcome
Throghout the unit I gained foundational knowledge of core computing disciplines, including Software Engineering, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and Enterprise IT Management. I learned how these areas integrate to solve complex business and societal challenges while considering ethical, legal, and professional implications.

## Practical Application
I applied practical computing principles to real-world problems, using methodologies like Agile and DevOps, data analytics, and cybersecurity frameworks, this had strengthened my ability to securly design efficient and ethical computing solutions.

## Critical Reflection
The module enhanced my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. I learned to assess the societal and ethical dimensions of technology, particularly regarding AI, data privacy, and equality in computing.

## Learning Process
Through guided research, collaborative exercises, and case analysis, I developed the ability to synthesise information, evaluate methodologies, and apply theoretical knowledge to practical computing challenges.

## Broader Context
This unit deepened my understanding of computing’s role in driving digital transformation, fostering innovation, and promoting equality, diversity, and inclusion within enterprise and society.

## Future Direction
I plan to further explore ethical AI, sustainable software engineering, and enterprise IT governance, focusing on how emerging technologies can support inclusive and responsible digital transformation.

### Feedback (tutor)

<details>
Your reflective presentation shows a strong understanding of the complex ethical and security challenges associated with AI adoption. You have successfully structured your slides around key themes such as AI foundations, real-world applications, governance, and ethical concerns. The integration of references to real frameworks (like GDPR and the EU AI Act) and case studies (e.g., Estonia and healthcare hackathons) demonstrates critical engagement and depth. The use of citations throughout adds credibility, and the transcript aligns well with academic and professional expectations. The flow between slides was logical, and your conclusions showed mature reflection on balancing innovation with accountability. However, there are areas where further refinement would improve your work. For instance, while the content was well-researched, some parts of the transcript could be more concise or paraphrased to avoid repetition, particularly in slides 6 and 7. Also, though your sources are appropriate, ensure that all data points, especially claims made about leadership accountability and HITL (human-in-the-loop), are consistently backed with direct references. You might also consider strengthening the reflection by including more personal insights about how this research influenced your thinking or professional perspective.

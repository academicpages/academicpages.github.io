The relevance of any possibly significant covariate when using a generalized linear model should be further investigate by means of an appropriate statistical
test. The most known parametric approach might fail when some assumptions are missing, losing the control of type I error. Permutation tests can often be useful in these situations, requiring fewer assumptions, and we will apply them in this general framework.

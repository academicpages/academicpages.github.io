excerpt: 'This research is the outcome of a group project for the course Activities in Economics 2. The objective is to analyze the determinants of informality in Peru and to identify the different impacts on the probability that a person is informal or not. For this purpose, the education, employment and income, income of the self-employed and summary modules of the 2019 ENAHO are used as a database. According to the main results, being a woman, being poor and not living in Metropolitan Lima increase the probability of being informal, and the age groups most likely to be informal are the youngest and the oldest (56 years and older). On the other hand, having more years of education, not working in a microenterprise or in the agricultural sector reduce the probability of being informal.'

excerpt: |
  As per Michael Halliday, language is not just a system of rules, but a tool for meaningmaking within sociocultural contexts, whereby language choices shape the functions of a text. We employ Julian House's Translation Quality Assessment model inspired by Halliday's Systemic Functional Linguistics to assess Machine Translation (MT) at the document level, establishing a novel approach titled FALCON (Functional Assessment of Language and COntextuality in Narratives). It is a skillspecific evaluation framework offering a holistic view of document-level translation phenomena with fine-grained context knowledge annotation. Rather than concentrating on the textual quality, our approach explores the discourse quality of translation by defining a set of core criteria on a sentence basis. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the inaugural attempt to extend MT evaluation into pragmatics. We revisit WMT 2024 with the English-to-X test set encompassing German, Spanish, and Icelandic, assessing 29 distinct systems in four domains. We present groundbreaking but compelling findings concerning document-level phenomena, which yield conclusions that differ from those established in existing research. Emphasizing the pivotal role of discourse analysis in current MT evaluation, our findings demonstrate a robust correlation with human values, inclusive of the ESA gold scores.

title: "Keypoint Cascade Voting for Point Cloud Based 6DoF Pose Estimation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/rcvpose3d
excerpt: 'We propose a novel keypoint voting 6DoF object 
pose estimation method, 
which takes
pure unordered point cloud
geometry as input.
The proposed cascaded keypoint
voting method,
called RCVPose3D,
is based upon a novel architecture
which separates the task of semantic segmentation
from that of keypoint regression,
thereby increasing the effectiveness
of both.
The method also introduces a
pairwise constraint
to the loss function,
which is shown to be effective,
as well as a novel 
Voter Confident Score 
which enhances both 
the learning and inference stages.
Our proposed RCVPose3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the Occlusion LINEMOD 74.5% and YCB-Video 96.9% datasets,
outperforming 
existing pure RGB and RGB-D
based methods,
as well as being competitive with RGB plus point cloud
methods.'

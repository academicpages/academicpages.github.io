**Abstract:** Lattice-free agent-based models (ABMs) of multicellular systems are mathematical
models in which each cell is represented individually and can move continuously
in space. In this chapter we present an overview of the methodology of ABMs that
are used to simulate mechanical and physiological phenomena in cells and
tissues. Lattice-free models are roughly categorized as center-based models,
deformable models, or hybrid approaches. This model variety allows to
simulate a broad scale of phenomena, ranging from monolayer growth, tumor
growth, wound healing, to organ modeling. However, every approach brings its
own difficulty and demands a particular care and expertise. We discuss here
numerical solution methods and implementations to describe the dynamics in
the different models.

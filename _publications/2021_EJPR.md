excerpt: 'This article explores the conditions under which female members of parliament are more likely than male MPs to participate in political debates relating to a range of issues. Building on descriptive representation theory and parliamentary behaviour studies, we examine how the effect of the number of women in parliament, and the access of women to leadership positions, affect the issue attention of MPs, and how these varies across policy areas and parliamentary venues. Oral questions asked by male and female MPs in plenary sessions and parliamentary committees in Spain from 1982 to 2018, show that numbers and leadership significantly affect female MPs’ attention to parliamentary activities that aim to highlight the merits of government action and in venues that are less open to public scrutiny. Our results also illustrate that the presence of women in parliament and their access to leadership positions have a significant impact on female MPs’ attention to rights- and welfare-related issues, but not issues traditionally linked to high-profile political areas such as national security, macroeconomic policy, and government affairs.'

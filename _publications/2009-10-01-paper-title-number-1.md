Currently, there is paucity in the knowledge on the exact effect of microgravity on the human brain and even more so – the scarce availability of comfortable, portable and wireless systems to measure the brain activity while studying microgravity. In this study we used portable, wireless electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) device to simultaneously record brain activity from a group of 6 subjects during a parabolic flight. Simultaneous local data collection and subsequent data export allowed for evaluation of brain activity of flyers during various gravity environment trials when experiencing martian, lunar and zero gravity. All individual subjects showed decrease in alpha, beta and theta band powers when compared between different Gs. Alpha power was depressed in 0 G when compared to both 1/6 G and 1/3 G in all subjects. Same results can be observed for beta and theta band powers. We believe that this study paves a promising direction to investigate the neuroscience of group interactions in ecologically natural settings of parabolic flights using portable EEG systems.

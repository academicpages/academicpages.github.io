abstract: 'Proton-powered c-ring rotation in mitochondrial ATP synthase is crucial to convert the transmembrane protonmotive force into torque to drive the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Capitalizing on recent cryo-EM structures, we aim at a structural and energetic understanding of how functional directional rotation is achieved. We performed multi-microsecond atomistic simulations to determine the free energy profiles along the c-ring rotation angle before and after the arrival of a new proton. Our results reveal that rotation proceeds by dynamic sliding of the ring over the a-subunit surface, during which interactions with conserved polar residues stabilize distinct intermediates. Ordered water chains line up for a Grotthuss-type proton transfer in one of these intermediates. After proton transfer, a high barrier prevents backward rotation and an overall drop in free energy favors forward rotation, ensuring the directionality of c-ring rotation required for the thermodynamically disfavored ATP synthesis. The essential arginine of the a-subunit stabilizes the rotated configuration through a salt bridge with the c-ring. Overall, we describe a complete mechanism for the rotation step of the ATP synthase rotor, thereby illuminating a process critical to all life at atomic resolution.'

With extensive eABF calculations, we reveal the mechanism of the 36 deg rotation step of the ATP synthase rotor, clarifying the water-mediated proton transfer pathway and the role of experimentally-detected intermediates.

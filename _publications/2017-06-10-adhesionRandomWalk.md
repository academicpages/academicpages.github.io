**Abstract:** Cellular adhesion provides one of the fundamental forms of
biological interaction between cells and their surroundings, yet the continuum
modelling of cellular adhesion has remained mathematically challenging. In 2006,
Armstrong et. al. proposed a mathematical model in the form of an
integro-partial differential equation. Although successful in
applications, a derivation from an underlying stochastic random walk
has remained elusive. In this work we develop a framework by which
non-local models can be derived from a space-jump process. We show how
the notions of motility and a cell polarization vector can be
naturally included. With this derivation we are able to include
microscopic biological properties into the model. We show that
particular choices yield the original Armstrong model, while others
lead to more general models, including a doubly non-local adhesion
model and non-local chemotaxis models. Finally, we use random walk
simulations to confirm that the corresponding continuum model
represents the mean field behaviour of the stochastic random walk.

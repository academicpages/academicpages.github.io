+ Develop a light-weighted auxiliary "little" module with random projection and weight quantization for probing Neural Network (NN) layerwise output sparsity to facilitate NN inference acceleration; 
+ The proposed scheme can be easily applied to various types of neural networks, such as CNN, and LSTM. (*e.g.*, on ResNet-18, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions with much higher FLOPs reduction, memory saving and model accuracy);
+ The proposed scheme can also be applied to various tasks, such as object detection (SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector).

excerpt: "Background: While advocates for integrating Computational Thinking (CT) into existing K12 classrooms have acknowledged and aimed to address various barriers to implementation, we contend that a more foundational issue—tensions between the epistemology of computing and those of existing disciplines—has largely been overlooked.  Studies of contact between heterogeneous disciplinary perspectives in both pedagogical and real world professional settings point to other risks, and harms, that educators may need to consider as they attempt to integrate CT into their teaching. As such, designing for integrated CT pedagogies does not simply require addressing functional problems such as teacher professional learning and limited classroom time, but rather implicates complex epistemological navigations. <br/>
Objective: This manuscript explores potential epistemic tensions between Computational Thinking (CT) and K12 humanities and arts disciplines and possibilities for their resolution. <br/>
Method: Based on a Delphi study with 43 experts from three disciplines—language arts, social studies, and arts—as they engaged in 20 hours of focus group conversations exploring potential approaches to integrating CT these disciplines, analysis focused on identifying potential epistemic tensions that can arise in the context of instruction and directions for their resolution. <br/>
Findings: We found 5 epistemic tensions that are explored in detail: contextual reductionism, procedural reductionism, epistemic chauvinism, threats to epistemic identities, and epistemic convergence, as well as a number of potential directions for navigating them. <br/>
Implications: The study’s findings provide insights that bear on both scholarship and pedagogical design aimed at promoting substantive interdisciplinary learning with CT, and, critically, navigating potential tensions that can arise within it."

**Abstract:** In 2006 Armstrong, Painter and Sherratt formulated a non-local
differential equation model for cell-cell adhesion. For the one dimensional case
we derive various types of adhesive, repulsive, and no-flux boundary conditions.
We prove local and global existence and uniqueness for the resulting
integro-differential equations. In numerical simulations we consider adhesive,
repulsive and neutral boundary conditions and we show that the solutions mimic
known behavior of fluid adhesion to boundaries. In addition, we observe interior
pattern formation due to cell-cell adhesion.

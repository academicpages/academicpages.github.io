**Abstract:**
Agent-based models (ABMs) of multicellular systems are models in which each cell
is represented individually. These models allow taking the variability between
individual cells and the spatial heterogeneity of tissues on histological scales
into account. In this chapter we present an overview and methodology of ABMs
that are used to simulate mechanical and physiological phenomena in cells and
tissues. ABMs are categorized as lattice based (cellular automata, lattice gas 
cellular automata, cellular Potts models), lattice free
(center-based models, deformable cell models, vertex models), or hybrid, which
are combinations of each of the latter. This model variety has been used to
simulate a broad scale of phenomena, ranging from monolayer growth, tumor
growth, wound healing, to organ modeling. Each approach has his strengths and
weaknesses that we discuss here and in the next chapter together with the
numerical solution methods and implementations. This chapter focuses on lattice
and the next chapter on off lattice-free ABMs. The aim is to assist researchers
in choosing the optimal model for the phenomenon they might want to model and
understand.

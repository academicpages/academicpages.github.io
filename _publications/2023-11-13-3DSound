excerpt: 'This study analyzes the impact of binaural sound in audio stories compared to their stereo versions on the listeners’ cognitive processing and physiological responses. An experimental study was conducted among fifty participants. Results showed the effectiveness of the binaural sound, which induces greater narrative engagement, enjoyment, imagery, and information recognition than the stereo stories. The psychophysiological responses also indicated the highest attention and arousal in binaural stories..'

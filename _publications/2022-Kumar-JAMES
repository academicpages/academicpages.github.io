This manuscript is in part an outcome of an Analysis, Integration, and Modeling of the Earth System (AIMES) workshop “Tackling Technical Challenges in Land Data Assimilation” held virtually in June 2021. In addition, the workshops organ- ized by the International Earth Surface Working Group in past years (2017–2022) have also contributed to the formulation of this article.

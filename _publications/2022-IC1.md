abstract: In this paper, we consider a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system that has a large number of transmit antennas at the base station serving multiple users in a downlink multi-cell system. In the massive MIMO system, the number of radio frequency chains and the total transmit power is increasing due to a large number of deployed antennas. The conventional energy-efficient optimization techniques are based on iterative numerical algorithms requiring high computational complexity. To solve this problem, we present a deep reinforcement learning-based power allocation scheme to improve the sum-rate and reduce the complexity. The simulation results demonstrate that the reinforcement learning-based power allocation methods achieve higher energy efficiency with lower complexity than existing optimization algorithms.

abstract: "This paper proposes a multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) based transmission power allocation technique for optimizing frequency efficiency and user fairness required in large-scale MIMO systems. The proposed method adaptively adjusts the preference weights of each index to determine the priority among multiple objectives (e.g., spectral efficiency and user fairness). At this time, frequency efficiency and user fairness are collected as a reward vector, and the preference weight of each objective is determined based on the posterior probability calculated by the Bayesian rule. Through experimental results, it has been confirmed that the proposed MORL-based power allocation technique can achieve optimization performance exceeding other techniques."

Determining the programming language of a source
code file has been considered in the research community; it has
been shown that Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) algorithms can be effective in identifying the
programming language of source code files. However, determining
the programming language of a code snippet or a few lines of
source code is still a challenging task. Online forums such as
Stack Overflow and code repositories such as GitHub contain
a large number of code snippets. In this paper, we describe
Source Code Classification (SCC), a classifier that can identify the
programming language of code snippets written in 21 different
programming languages. A Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)
classifier is employed which is trained using Stack Overflow
posts. It is shown to achieve an accuracy of 75% which is higher
than that with Programming Languages Identification (PLI–a
proprietary online classifier of snippets) whose accuracy is only
55.5%. The average score for precision, recall and the F1 score
with the proposed tool are 0.76, 0.75 and 0.75, respectively. In
addition, it can distinguish between code snippets from a family
of programming languages such as C, C++ and C#, and can also
identify the programming language version such as C# 3.0, C#
4.0 and C# 5.0.

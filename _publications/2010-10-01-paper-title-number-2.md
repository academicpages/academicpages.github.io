title: "The creative destruction of AI on occupations: evidence from U.S. Metropolitan Areas"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'Studies on the relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and labor market dynamics are often conducted at the national scale, but often ignore heterogenous impacts across regions. This paper adopts a geographical perspective to assess the creative destruction of AI on occupations. Based on the co-evolution of AI technology development and occupation shares at the regional level, we develop a Spatial AI Occupation Index that makes a distinction between augmentation and substitution effects of AI on occupations. We find that MSAs with high AI patenting intensity show higher growth in the share of occupations carrying out non-routine cognitive analytical and interpersonal tasks, in particular those in line with the production and early adoption of AI technologies, while their share of workers performing routine manual tasks is in decline. AI also leads to shifting occupational specialization of regions: high AI-intensive MSAs are increasingly specialized in non-routine occupations that require creativity and interpersonal skills. This indicates that AI-intensive regions are likely to be resilient and prosper from the AI transition while regions that specialize in routine occupations are at risk of losing out.'

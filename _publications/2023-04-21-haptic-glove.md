This paper presents a pneumatically actuated haptic feedback glove for interacting with 3D objects in a mixed-reality environment for rehabilitation purposes. The glove is lightweight and easily reproducible, with a soft pneumatic mechanism and modular design. The mixed reality techniques generate adjustable force feedback for a realistic sensation of touching virtual objects.

This report extends the work of Rafaila et al, "A  Dataset  of  Open-Source Safety-Critical Software", with metadata concerning the project's development practices and safety goals.
Our analysis (1) describes the level to
which open-source projects seek to meet safety standards and (2)
describes the projects’ development practices used to integrate
community contributions while maintaining safety standards.

The extended dataset is available here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HlQkQLUdyf8l_mIy6QRjxTY3iDrK724wXQCHH8ucAbM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HlQkQLUdyf8l_mIy6QRjxTY3iDrK724wXQCHH8ucAbM/edit?usp=sharing)

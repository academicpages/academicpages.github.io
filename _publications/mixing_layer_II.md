### Abstract  

Turbulent Radiative Mixing Layers (TRMLs) form at the interface of cold, dense gas and hot, diffuse
gas in motion with each other. TRMLs are ubiquitous in and around galaxies on a variety of scales,
including galactic winds and the circumgalactic medium. They host the intermediate temperature
gases that are efficient in radiative cooling, thus play a crucial role in controlling the cold gas supply,
phase structure, and spectral features of galaxies. In this work, we introduce a simple parameterization
of the effective turbulent conductivity and viscosity that enables us to develop a simple and intuitive
analytic 1.5 dimensional model for TRMLs. Our analytic model reproduces the mass flux, total
cooling, and phase structure of 3D simulations of TRMLs at a fraction of the computational cost. It
also reveals essential insights into the physics of TRMLs, particularly the importance of the viscous
dissipation of relative kinetic energy in balancing radiative cooling. This dissipation takes place both
in the intermediate temperature phase, which offsets the enthalpy flux from the hot phase, and in the
cold phase, which enhances radiative cooling. Additionally, our model provides a fast and easy way
of computing the column density and surface brightness of TRMLs, which can be directly linked to
observations.

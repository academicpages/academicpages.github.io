Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) cluster analysis is widely popular for finding neural activation associated with some stimulus. However, it
suffers from the spatial specificity paradox, and making follow-up inference inside clusters is not allowed. Valid double-dipping can be performed by closed testing, which determines lower confidence bounds for the number of active voxels, simultaneously over all regions. Moreover, a permutation framework adapts to the unknown joint distribution of the data. In the fMRI context, we evaluate two methods that rely on closed testing and permutations: permutation-based true discovery guarantee by sum tests, and permutation-based All-Resolutions Inference.

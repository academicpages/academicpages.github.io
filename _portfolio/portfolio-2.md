title: "Multi-rate Learned Image Compression"
excerpt: "Re-implementation of "Asymmetric Gained Deep Image Compression With Continuous Rate Adaptation" by Cui et al. (2021)"

This is a slightly different re-implementation of the work by [Cui et al. (2021)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Cui_Asymmetric_Gained_Deep_Image_Compression_With_Continuous_Rate_Adaptation_CVPR_2021_paper.html). For further detail about the model structure and how multiple rate-distortion trade-offs are achieved using single model, please refer to the paper. Upto my knowledge, [this](https://github.com/erenovic/Flex-Rate-MBT2018) is the first unofficial re-implementation of this wonderful work.

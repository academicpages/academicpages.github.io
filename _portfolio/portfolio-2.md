This project focuses on the development of an **intelligent human zone tracking system using computer vision techniques**. **The goal of the system** is to **detect human presence**, count **working time**, and analyze **interactions** within predefined spatial zones, which is highly relevant for applications in smart environments, safety monitoring, and automation systems.

The system processes **recorded video streams** to identify humans and determine whether they working, or remain within specific regions of interest. By combining image processing, **object detection**, and **face identification**, the project demonstrates a practical approach to vision-based situational awareness.

Highlights: <br/>
- **Human Detection and Tracking:** Implemented robust human detection and tracking using computer vision algorithms to monitor movement across frames. 
- **Zone-Based Analysis:** Defined virtual zones within the camera frame to analyze human presence. <br/>
- **Practical Applications:** Applicable to security systems, smart buildings, industrial safety monitoring, and human–machine interaction scenarios.

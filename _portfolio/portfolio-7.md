## Overview

This Heart Disease Detector project is a simple implementation of a logistic regression model for predicting the presence of heart disease in patients based on a dataset from Kaggle. The model has achieved an accuracy of 0.81 on the training dataset, indicating its potential for assisting in early heart disease detection.

## Introduction

Heart disease is a prevalent and potentially life-threatening condition. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. Machine learning models, like the one implemented in this project, can assist medical professionals in diagnosing heart disease more accurately.


## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: [Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci). It contains various features related to a patient's health and a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease. You can download the dataset from the provided link and place it in the project directory.

## Model Performance

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 0.81 on the training dataset. It's essential to evaluate the model's performance further, considering metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Additionally, you should perform cross-validation and assess its performance on an independent test dataset to ensure its reliability.

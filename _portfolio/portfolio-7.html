title: "Ordered soft granular media"
excerpt: "Under external perturbations, inter-particle forces in disordered granular media are well known to form a heterogeneous distribution with filamentary patterns. Better understanding these forces and the distribution is
important for predicting the collective behavior of granular media, the media second only to water as the most manipulated material in global industry. However, studies in this regard so far have been largely confined to
granular media exhibiting only geometric heterogeneity, leaving the dimension of mechanical heterogeneity a rather uncharted area. Here, through a FEM contact mechanics model, we show that a heterogeneous inter-
particle force distribution can also emerge from the dimension of mechanical heterogeneity alone. Specifically, we numerically study inter-particle forces in packing of mechanically heterogeneous disks arranged over either a
square or a hexagonal lattice and under quasi-static biaxial compression. Our results show that, at the system scale, a hexagonal packing exhibit a more heterogeneous inter-particle force distribution than a square packing
does; At the particle scale, for both packing lattices, preliminary analysis shows the consistent coexistence of outliers (i.e., softer disks sustaining larger forces while stiffer disks sustaining smaller forces) in comparison to
their homogeneous counterparts, which implies the existence of nonlocal effect. Further analysis on the portion of outliers and on spatial contact force correlations suggest that the hexagonal packing shows more pronounced
nonlocal effect over the square packing under small mechanical heterogeneity. However, such trend is reversed when assemblies becomes more mechanically heterogeneous. Lastly, we confirm that, in the absence of particle
reorganization events, contact friction merely plays the role of packing stabilization while its variation has little effect on inter-particle forces and their distribution."

<span> Under external perturbations, inter-particle forces in disordered granular media are well known to form a heterogeneous distribution with filamentary patterns. Better understanding these forces and the distribution is
important for predicting the collective behavior of granular media, the media second only to water as the most manipulated material in global industry. However, studies in this regard so far have been largely confined to

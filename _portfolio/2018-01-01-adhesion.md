When cells in a tissue exert traction forces, they pull on one another and on
the underlying matrix, much like a tug of war.  Since cells can extend long
protrusions (over several cell diameters), such effects act over long distances
(nonlocal), and not simply by neighbour-to-neighbour (local) contact. But most
traditional continuum models (PDEs) can only describe local interactions. I use
integro-PDEs to capture these nonlocal mechanical tissue stresses.
The prototypical cell adhesion model is:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} - \alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( u(x,t) \int_{-R}^{R} h(u(x+r,t))\Omega(r)\, \mathrm{d} r \right),$$

where $u(x,t)$ is the cell density, at location $x$ and time $t$, $R$ the
cell sensing radius, $\alpha$ the homotypic adhesion strength, $\omega(r)$ an
even function, and $h(u)$ a function describing adhesion bond kinetics.

**A:** Typical solutions of the Armstrong adhesion model for varying $\alpha$.  The initial condition is in blue (dashed), the steady state solution is in black (solid). The remaining curves are intermediate times.  A bifurcation occurs between $\alpha = 1$ and $\alpha=10$.  Numerical solution via a finite volume scheme. (w. ROWMAP integrator).
**B:** Bifurcation diagram of the linear Armstrong model via continuation and spectral collocation using my toolbox. The insets show typical solutions.
**C:** My global bifurcation result, classifying solutions along branches, written as a "meta-theorem".

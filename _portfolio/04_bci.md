<!-- Introduction of the project -->
This was a course project at the EPFL Brain Computer Interaction (BCI) class at EPFL.

Motor Imagery (MI) involves activation of the neural
system while a person imagines performing a task or
body movement without actually physically performing
the movement. As changes in the brain rythms are observed in the sensory-motor area of brain during planning
and execution of movements, we are able to detect the synchronization and desynchronization of these rythms during and after MI.

 Under the supervision of a PhD student and in a group of four, we were to acquire EEG data and process it to detect the end of a motor imagery period.

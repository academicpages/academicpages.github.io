title: "Characterizing Key White Shark Habitat"
excerpt: "White sharks are known to migrate across the Pacific Ocean to the lee of Hawai’i Island in the spring and early summer. Little is known about why white sharks perform this migration and how key oceanographic features like eddies and seamounts affect their behavior. We analyzed novel white shark Pop-up Satellite Tag (PSAT) data tracking both males and females migrating to the lee of Hawaii and performing diel vertical migrations. We also performed in-situ sampling of oceanography in the region, targeting eddies, eddy fronts, and seamounts to rationalize these migrations. Data from CTD hydrocasts, ADCP sampling, and meter net tows suggest that the core of anticyclonic eddies, peripheries of cyclonic eddies, and seamounts are structuring vibrant mesopelagic communities in the area. <br/><img src='/images/ws_hawaii.png'>"

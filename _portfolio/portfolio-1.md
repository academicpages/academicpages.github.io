title: "‘Drishti’ a Vision Depth-Sensing using SLAM"
excerpt: "This project is developed under the Texas instrument’s IIDC competition and is currently a semi-finalist for the same. We have developed a vision-based depth projecting camera module that will enable simultaneous localisation and produce a 3D map of its surroundings. Using the onboard beaglebone black we have used to accelerate the GPU and processes the images captured by the stereo camera. We have used OpenCV for camera calibration and depth perception and have used ORBSLAM2 for the 3D reconstruction and trajectory mapping."

title: "Advancing Single Cell Genomics towards Better Molecular Medicine"
excerpt: "I was a key contributor to the Tabula Sapiens Consortium. We generated a multi-organ, single-cell transcriptomic atlas of humans. This atlas will be a reference for researchers attempting to understand the molecular basis of diseases. I analyzed the cells from the human immune system and pushed forward wet-lab efforts to perfrom scVDJ sequencing. \n <br/><img src='/images/reduced_ts_figure.png'>"

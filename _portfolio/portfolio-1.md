This academic research project, currently under review for publication in **IEEE**, focused on enabling a **Unitree Go2 quadruped robot** to autonomously operate elevators. The system was designed to expand the mobility of legged robots in real-world indoor environments, where vertical navigation is essential.

The robot was equipped with **ROS2**, the **Unitree SDK**, and **computer vision techniques** to achieve perception and control. Using **AprilTag detection**, the robot could accurately identify elevator panels, perform precise docking maneuvers, and press the correct buttons autonomously.  

Highlights: <br/><br/>
- **Autonomous Elevator Operation**: Successfully integrated perception, planning, and actuation to allow the robot to detect panels, dock, and press buttons without human intervention. <br/>
- **Computer Vision Integration**: Used AprilTag technology to ensure robust detection of elevator panels in varied lighting and angle conditions. <br/>
- **Seamless Control**: Combined ROS2 middleware, the Unitree SDK, and custom navigation algorithms to achieve reliable performance. <br/>
- **Research Contribution**: Project submitted to IEEE, contributing to advancements in mobile robotics and service robot autonomy. <br/>

Paris has a rich cultural history, and despite growing up there, I realized I still don't know the origins behind the names of most metro stations, which are often rooted in historical events. To address this, I developed an app that provides historical insights into Parisian metro stations. The app maps all metro locations on a 2D grid (organized by lines) and links each station to a description of the origin of its name.

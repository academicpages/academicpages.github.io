<h2> Projects: </h2>
<h3>Design and structural analysis of 3D anti-vortex tube (AVT)</h3>
<br>
**Client**: Pratt & Whitney
<br>
**Timeline**: Jun '16 - Jan '17
<br>
**Project Details**:
The main objective of this project was to optimize the design of AVT assembly which did not meet the life criteria.

Prepared the finite element (FE) model of 3D AVT assembly within 2D high pressure compressor (HPC) assembly on Ansys V14.5. In order to explore the model as a whole, 2D and 3D were modelled in combination. Next, the boundary conditions and loads were applied for the critical time points of MTGW and AD27 missions for life and for burst margin calculations. inear static stress analysis was conducted for the crucial time points across various design iterations and material combinations of the AVT assembly to address and rectify the design issues. To conduct the thermal analysis, the sub-modeling concept was employed. Thermal loads were extracted from the model featuring the HPC alone and then transferred to the 3D components of the AVT assembly. A comprehensive result presentation and stress summary for the AVT assembly were compiled and the status was communicated to senior management through the use of burndown and dashboard charts.

<h3>Structural analysis of integrated bladed rotors (IBRs) numbered 5 to 8 of business aviation(BA) and 30,000 lbf of thrust(30k) engines</h3>
<br>
**Client**: Pratt & Whitney
<br>
**Timeline**: Dec '15 - Jun '16
<br>
**Project Details**:
The goal of this project was to perform the HCF structural analysis on integrated bladed rotors stages 5–8 to assess the life at the leading edge, trailing edge, trench, and balance cut locations as per the criteria mentioned in the engineering statement of work (ESW).

Developed a finite element (FE) model for the IBR sub-model, ensuring that the mesh error remained within the 30% error criteria at critical locations. These locations included the leading and trailing edges of the airfoil, trenches on the rotor rim surface, and the balance cut region, all implemented using ANSYS 14.5. The sub-model was prepared based on the requirement, considering both a single sector and, at times, a $180^{\circ}$ model. Boundary conditions and loads for all the time points of a mission were applied. Once again, the sub-modeling concept was employed to conduct the thermal analysis. Thermal loads and cut boundary conditions were obtained from the global model and applied to this sub-model. Prepared and reported a detailed result pitch and stress summary of all critical locations.

<h3>Structural Analysis of front hub with balance mass and rivets</h3>
<br>
**Client**: Pratt & Whitney
<br>
**Timeline**: Jan '15 - Apr '15
<br>
**Project Details**:
The aim of this project was to conduct static stress analysis on the front hub with a balance mass and rivets. The redesign of the model is focused on assessing the life at critical locations such as the front hub oil drain slots, flow hole, rivet hole, and balance cut location. This evaluation aligns with the specifications outlined in the engineering statement of work (ESW). Additionally, the project involved checking the deflection of the front hub arm and ensuring clearance between the front hub and the stator knife edge.

The FE model of the front hub with balance mass and rivets sub-model was created using ANSYS V14.5, ensuring that the mesh error remained below the 30% error criteria at critical locations, specifically the rivet holes of the balance mass, oil drain slot, balance cut, and flow hole of the front hub. Boundary conditions and loads were applied for all the time points throughout the entire mission duration. The sub-modeling concept was utilized to extract thermal and cut boundary conditions from the global model. A comprehensive result presentation and stress summary were prepared for all critical locations. Depending on the size of the model, two to three sub-models were considered.

<h3>Structural analysis on BA and 30k global model</h3>
<br>
**Client**: Pratt & Whitney
<br>
**Timeline**: Jan '15 - Apr '15
<br>
**Project Details**:
The primary objectives of this task included:
* Defining attributes, including thermal and pressure loads, within Pratt & Whitney Auto Modeler (PWAM), an in-house modeling tool employed for generating finite element models. These models were subsequently analyzed using Unigraphics (UG) NX7.5 and ANSYS V12.0.
* Simulating the assembly of the global model to accommodate various types of missions and flight cycles.

Attributes of the global model were defined using the Pratt and Whitney Automodeler (PWAM) tool, which generates an optimized finite element model with thermal and pressure components essential for analysis. The mesh error percentage at critical locations of Rotors 5 to 8, front hub, aft hub, and on the tie-shaft was verified to ensure compliance with the 30% error criteria. The global model incorporated HPC, high-pressure turbine (HPT), #3 bearing, and #4 bearing assemblies. A comprehensive analysis was conducted for all time points corresponding to various missions and different thermal conditions. Three preloads were taken into account for the analysis, simulated at the HPC, HPT, and #4 bearing locations of the tie shaft, as well as through interference fit at the #3 bearing location. Following the application of the necessary preload, static stress analysis was conducted for the entire flight cycle to examine the stress and displacements of the global model. Subsequently, this global model was utilized to extract loads and boundary conditions for sub-models. PW life input files were generated using a tool called Surf life.

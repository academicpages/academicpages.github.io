In this post, the sixth lecture of CS50 is summarized.

# Resizing Arrays
Assume that we defined an array of integer with size 3(12 bytes). Suppose now we want to add a fourth number to the array. Since we don't know what's going on the computer's memory right next to the array we defined(just by bad luck, string "hello, wrold\0" could be allocated right next to the array), we can't simply add the fourth integer right next to it.  
!!! pic of 123 hello world garbange values.!!!
One solution for this problem is to abstract the array and move to a different location of bigger memory. 
```c
int list[3];

list[0] = 1;
list[1] = 2;
list[2] = 3;
```
Now, I want to copy the 'list' array to new array with size 4 and remove the old one. In order to do this, I can't use an traditional array syntax to define 'list' because that makes the variable, forever of size 3 and can't free it. Instead, we will use mallic.
```c
int *list = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
if (list == NULL){
  return 1;
}

list[0] = 1;
list[1] = 2;
list[2] = 3;
```
In extreme cases malloc can return not the address of an actual chunk of memory. In cases of error, it will return NULL which represents address 0. It's a good practice to check whether malloc returns NULL.
We can still use the bracket when assigning the values because 'list' is still a chunk of memory. We can treat this chunk of memory as though it's an array(think about pointer arithmetic in last week).
Now let's assume in this moment I want to dynamically allocate more space and free up the old.
```c
int *list = malloc(3 * sizeof(int));
if (list == NULL){
  return 1;
}

list[0] = 1;
list[1] = 2;
list[2] = 3;

int *tmp = malloc(4 * sizeof(int));
if (tmp == NULL){
  free(list);
  return 1;
}

```
In the line where I defined 'tmp', the computer gives you space for 4 integers elsewhere that might very well be grabage values now. 
I should not forget to free up 'list' when 'tmp' equals to NULL because otherwise, memory leak will occur. This is where C does get a little annoying because the programmer have to remember all of these details. Although technically when any progam quits, all of the memory is going to be given back to the operating system, but still it's a good practice.

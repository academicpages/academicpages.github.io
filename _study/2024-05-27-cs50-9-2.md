In this post, the shorts video of the ninth lecture of CS50 is summarized.

# SQL
- SQL is a programming language whose purpose is to query a database.
- MySQL is one open-source platform on which you can establish the type of relational database that SQL is most adept at working with. SQLite is a more light weight version of it.
- Many installations of SQL come with a GUI tool called phpMyAdmin which can be used to execute database queries in a more user-friendly way.

## creating table
- After you create a database, the next thing you'll most likely want to do is create a table.
  - The syntax for doing this is actually a bit awkward to do programmatically, at least at the outset, and so this is where phpMyAdmin will come in handy.
- As part of the process of creating a talbe, you'll be asked to specify all of the columns in that table.
- Thereafter, all your queries will refer to rows of the table.
- Each column of your SQL talbe is capable of holding data of a particular data type.

## char vs varchar
- Unlike in C, the CHAR data type in SQL does not refer to a single character. Rather, it is a fixed-length string.
  - In most relational databases, including MySQL, you actually specify the fixed-length as part of the type definition, e.g. CHAR(10)
- A VARCHAR refers to a variable-length string.
  VARCHARs also require you to specify the mzximum possible length of a string that could be stored in that column, e.g. VARCHAR(99)

In this post, the fifth lecture of CS50 is summarized.

# Memory
As we seen before, our computer is just grid of memory, where each of these squares represents a single byte. Computers typically use numbers to represent all of the bytes in their memory, and they typically use hexadecimal notation for such by convention. 
```c
int main(void){
  int n = 50;
}
```
![memory7](..\images\2024-04-12-cs50-5\memory7.jpg)
When you write the line of code above, that 50 and that variable n, live somewhere in the computer's memory. In C, there is a syntax that gives you access to the locations of variables inside of the computer's memory. By using '&' which is called the 'address of operator', you can ask the computer at what address is this variable. The '*', which called "dereference operator", allows you to take an address and go to it. 

```c
int main(void){
  int n = 50;
  printf("%p\n", &n);
}
```
```console
0x7ffc3a7cffbc
```
If I run the code as above, I can get the memory location where variable n is stored. At the moment I run the code, on the server, the location is 0x7ffc3a7cffbc. The %p symbol we're passing into printf as a format code is leveraging the fact that C supports pointers.



# Pointers
A pointer is an address of variable that you can store in another variable called itself a pointer. 
```c
int n = 50;
int *p = &n;
```
In the code above, we created an pointer, a variable whose purpose is to store the address of some value. If you want 'p' to be a pointer, a variable that stores an address, you add '\*' in front of the variable name. '\*' in this case is different from the '\*' that I mentioned earlier in the Memory part. Below is the code to see the address of the variable n.
```c
int main(void){
  int n = 50;
  int *p = &n;
  printf("%p\n, p);
}
```
I can also reverse this process. I can ask the computer "go to the address of n and tell me what is there." It is possible by the following code.
```c
int main(void){
  int n = 50;
  int *p = &n;
  printf("%i\n", *p);
}
```
Inside of the printf function '\*p' means go to the address and show me what's inside of the computer's memory there. Clearly we are using '\*' in two different locations. When I specify a data type like int, and then I have a '\*', and then the name of a variable, that is the syntax for declaring a pointer. When I write '\*' and then the name of a pointer without specifying a type, this means go there. 
Since 'p' itself is another variable, so it's got to live somewhere in the computer's memory. By convention, pointers take up more space. They typically use 8 bytes nowadays, rather than 4.

# string
When we declare a string variable, since we learned that string is an array of chars, it is stored in the memory of contiguous addresses. 
```c
string s = "HI!";
```
![memory10](..\images\2024-04-12-cs50-5\memory10.jpg)
What is 's' then in the code above? 's' it self, is a pointer. 's' is the address of the string. The string is somewhere in memory, but 's' itself is a seperate variable that gives you a clue as how to find all of those characters in memory. In this case '0x123' might well suffice as the value of 's'. It is because that essentially gives you enough information to find the beginning of the string "HI!". If 's' storing the location of the beginning of the string, someone's got to keep track of where the string ends, and that's effectively the string itself because there is a NUL at the end of the string. You can use a for loop, a while loop, to visit through the each character of string.

![memory9](..\images\2024-04-12-cs50-5\memory9.jpg)

```c
int main(void){
  string s = "Hi!";
  printf("%p\n", s);
  printf("%p\n", &s[0]);
  printf("%p\n", $s[1]);
  printf("%p\n", &s[2]);
  printf("%p\n", &s[3]);

}
```
```console
0x5586554ce004
0x5586554ce004
0x5586554ce005
0x5586554ce006
0x5586554ce007
```
The code above shows that the variable of type string stores the memory address of the first character. Also, we can see the characters is stored in the contiguous bytes of memory. 
Now, we know that 'string s = "HI!"' is equal to the below.
```c
char *s = "HI!"
```
In CS50, the staff invented the data type called string, just to hide this lower level detail. But why don't we use the '&' symbol in this case? The C compiler, Clang, is smart enough to realize when it sees double quotes around a sequence of characters, it wants to put the address of that first char in the variable for you.
## typedef
With typedef, you can create your own data types. For example, you can create you own data type called integer, that itself is a synonym for int as below. 
```c
typedef int integer;
```
C has no data type for a byte. There is no built in obvious way to represent eight bits and store whatever you want in them. However, you can use what's called a  uint8_t, which is a data type that comes with C. It's a lot more convinient to think of a BYTE as being its own data type. When you want to write code that manipulates one or two or more bytes, it would be nice to have a data type called BYTE.
```c
typedef uint8_t BYTE;
```
So whawt is in the CS50 header file? Literally, this line of code.
```c
typedef char *string;
```


# Pointer Arithmetic
Now we can think 's' below as an array, but also a pointer. In this regard, the follwing two codes will give you an same output.
```c
char *s = "HI!";
printf("%c\n", s[0]);
printf("%c\n", s[1]);
printf("%c\n", s[2]);
```
```c
char *s = "HI!";
printf("%c\n", *s);
printf("%c\n", *(s + 1));
printf("%c\n", *s(s + 2));
```
Array syntax is a "syntatic sugar" for a pointer. When you say s[0], the compiler is essentially doing *s.

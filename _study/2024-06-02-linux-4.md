In this post, the concept of .bashrc is introduced.

# .bashrc
When a user first runs bash, it is designed to execute a specific set of files. These files can vary and be executed depending on the context. However for now, we will only consider the .bashrc file located in the home directory. By customizing the .bashrc file, we can modify our shell's start-up configuration. 

## $PATH
In order to add locations to $PATH, you can do as follows.
- open .bashrc file
    ```console
    vi ~/.bashrc
    ```
- add PATH
    ```console
    export PATH = "$PATH:/your/new/path"
    ```
    "$PATH:" means you append your new directory to existing $PATH data. If you do not write it, it will overwrite.
- source .bashrc
    ```console
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

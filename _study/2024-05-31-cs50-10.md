In this post, the tenth lecture of CS50 is summarized.

# The Internet
Nowadays, every computers is interconnected either with wires or wirelessly. How? Routers are computers, servers whose purpose in life is to route information from left to right, top to bottom geographically to get data from point A to B. But typically, you're not going to have a direct connection between A and B. You might have many different servers between you and someone else. If you send email to your friend, that email is going to be put inside packet. That packet pass through of any number of routers. We have software nowadays that dynamically figures out the best path of routers. 

## TCP/IP
What is router sending? A packet is a generic term for some amount of information. TCP/IP is a pair of protocols that the internet generally uses nowadays to get data from point A to B.
IP stands for internet protocol. Every computer, every internet work device in the world has an IP address that uniquely represent computers - that's a bit of a white lie because there's way to share IP addresses. IP address is formatted as #.#.#.# where each # represents a vallue between 0 ~ 255. So IP address is generally 4 bytes. However, 4 billion is not enough nowadays considering number of internet devices in the world. The world is gradually in the process of transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6. In IPv6, 128 bits are used.

Above is the layout of certain IP packets. We'll focus on Source Address and Destination Address. The most important thing IP does is it mandates computers on the internet minimally provide a source address and a destination address.
IP alone doesn't guarantee delivery because sometimes the packet might not get to its destination. More technically, that might happen because the router is overwhelmed - there's not enough room in its memory to keep up with the traffic. People usually use TCP in conjunction with IP. TCP guarantees delivery by having device to write a sequence number. TCP gives us one other feature, port numbers. Ports indicate which programs to open the packet - email program, video conferencing program, etc. Two of the most common port numbers in TCP are 80, which represents the web - HTTP - and 443 whcih represents HTTPS.

Just like with IP, TCP has fields look like this. In short, IP standardizes how the addresses work and TCP guarantees delivery with those sequence numbers and also helps the servers do more than one thing.

## DNS
On the internet, there's another type of server that are all over the place in your home, on campus known as DNS (Domain Name System) servers. DNS server answers questions of the form what is the IP address for certain domain name. If you type harvard.enu in your web browser, what your device is designed to do is to ask local DNS server on campus, on your mobile carrier's network, on your apartment network, what is the IP address of harvard.edu. And the local DNS server will respond with a numeric address.
DNS server is fitting the mdel of a dictionary or hash table whereby inside of a DNS server is essentially a dictionary. 2 columns databse table.

There's hierarchy in DNS servers such that your phone will generally ask the nearest DNS server which is usually owned by your internet service provider at home, in your apartment, or by university. If that local DNS server does not have the answer, it's going to ask to a server with higher status in hierarchy. There are finite number of root servers in the world that know about all domain names and their IP addresses.
How does all this get started? At the first time you visit campus, you would configure your PC to know the IP addresses of your nearest router, and DNS server. Someone would come to your home when signing up for internet service and configure your PC for you. Nowadays it happens automatically by DHCP servers. 

## DHCP
DHCP servers answers questions of the form "what should be my DNS server and router". Nowadays, if you turn on your phone, it broadcasts a Hello, World message, which is asking the local network "what IP address should I use for my DNS server and for my router." And hopefully, your university or your apartment has a DHCP server nearby to answer that question. DHCP server also do is it tells your device what IP addresses your device should use. At the very beginning of your visit to campus, you did register somehow - logged in and authenticated against your university account - and that enabled the DHCP servers henceforth to recognize your particular computer and answer those questions for you.

[Fibrations For Toposes, PSSL 101, Leeds, UK ](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtng/Hazratpour.pdf)

`Abstract:` For many special constructions of topological spaces (which for us will be point-free, and generalized in the sense of Grothendieck), a structure preserving map between the presenting structures gives a map between the
corresponding spaces. Two very simple examples are: a function $f\colon X \to Y$ between sets already is a map between the corresponding discrete spaces; and a homomorphism $f\colon K \to L$ between two distributive lattices gives a map _in the opposite direction_ between their spectra. The covariance or contravariance of this correspondence is a fundamental property of the construction.

Borrowing from work of Ross Street we define a notion of (op)fibration in the 2-category $\Con$ of contexts developed in [Vickers, 16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01559).  We establish that for every context extension (op)fibration $\thT_1 \to \thT_0$ in $\Con$ any model $M$ of $T_0$ in an elementary topos $\CS$ with natural number object gives rise to an (op)fibration for toposes with codomain $\CS$, in the sense of [Johnstone, 1993](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00880041).

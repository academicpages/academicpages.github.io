## Abstract 
<p>
In this work, we compare the performances between a combinatorial approach by Erdös [1] and approaches based on the non-zero entries of eigenvectors correspond- ing to the extremal eigenvalues of four different matrices: adjacency, Laplacian, normalized Laplacian and signless Laplacian matrix, in identifying the largest bipartite subgraphs of a simple connected graph. We employ these approaches to one scale-free and three random graph models, which cover a wide range of real-world networks. It is observed that the normalized Laplacian and the adjacency matrix based approaches yield slightly better but comparable results to that of the com- binatorial approach. Using these two matrices, we subsequently formulate a new index, analogous to the edge bipartivity index of Estrada and Rodríguez-Velázquez [2]. Our results indicate that the application of this new index not only signifi- cantly outperforms combinatorial approach but also performs better than the edge bipartivity index in identifying the largest bipartite subgraphs.</p>

Keywords: Bipartite subgraphs, Edge bipartivity, Combinatorial approach for bi- partition, Spectral approach for bipartition.

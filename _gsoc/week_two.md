This is the second week of my GSoC journey.

GSoC project
=================
*  [GSoC project URL](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/HKW6ydaI)
*  [Work Repository](https://github.com/Mustardburger/CellBox)

Tasks
=================
1. Finish prototype for Pytorch dataloader.
2. Create the file `dataset_torch.py` that replaces `dataset.py`.
When `dataset_torch.py` is done, subsequent calls for instantiating the dataloader in `main.py` should be: `cfg = cellbox.dataset_torch.factory(cfg)`.

Relevant issues:
================


Notes
=================
Check out my [personal GSoC notebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYkUNYuRcPHByWUYay6yUeTKtBuiwTGKJoztT0LajiA/edit?usp=sharing), where I keep my observations and comments in one place.

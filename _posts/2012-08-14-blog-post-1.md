This weekend, the BFS core members competed at a 48 hour hackathon called NASA SPACE APPS.


I was able to find the hackathon through devpost, and after searching I decided it was perfect to compete in. We competed in a challenge called "Beyond Sunlight: An Aquatic Chemosynthetic World". This challenge invites participants to design an ocean world where chemosynthesis, rather than photosynthesis, sustains life, exploring unique ecosystems and geological features that enable life to thrive without sunlight. By envisioning how life adapts to chemical energy sources from geological processes, participants can push the boundaries of astrobiology and imagine new possibilities for life on other planets.


For our project, we crafted a fictional story about K2-18b, an exoplanet near the star Leo, which is thrown out of its orbit due to a cosmic event like a supernova or a collision of star systems. As the planet drifts into the Buttes Void, it experiences extreme environmental changes that lead to the loss of its vibrant life. Over time, the planet's unique conditions foster new geological formations and energy sources. Ultimately, these transformations reshape the planet's future in this new cosmic landscape.


One of the organisms we created is the Piezo Tree, a plantlike organism that evolved to harness energy from piezoelectric crystals on the ocean floor. Over time, it developed specialized ion channels and proton pumps, allowing it to convert mechanical stress into chemical energy through electrosynthesis. These adaptations enable the tree to store and use electrical energy for growth and repair, even in the dark, energy-scarce depths of the ocean. Different species of the Piezo Tree have diversified across oceanic zones, from the sunlight-filled epipelagic to the trench-like hadal zone, thriving in areas with varying seismic activity.


We were also able to meet many amazing people, including astronaut Woody Hoburg, who was part of the 69th mission to the ISS.

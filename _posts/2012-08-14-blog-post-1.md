This post refers to my _Pre-Scientific Initiation_ in **Superconducticity**, that I have made from 2009 to 2011 (my highschool years), under advisor of [Professor Antonio Carlos Hernandes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2019448857205643). It is really important to say that, in this work, I have been co-advised by Professors [Ariane Baffa Lourenço](http://lattes.cnpq.br/1241656328850074) and [Marcelo Rubens Barsi Andreeta](http://lattes.cnpq.br/7904227795652627), from wich, together with Professor Hernandes, I own a lot about my knowledge about scientific writting and materials production.

Superconductivity
======

The **superconductivity** is a phenomena based on quantum theory expressing the absence of eletric resistence and beeing able to promote eletromagnetic levitation. Yeah, at that time I felt like I am the one producing the 'possible devices' for the Back to the Future hoverboard (but not at the room temperature :p).

Using just a few words, I studied what a high scooler could touch about the superconductivity theory, I had prepared a cuprate pellet (made of yttrium, barium and copper) and I made a scheme to a support, to present its magnetic levitation effect into the science fair of my school.

Historic aspects
------
Superconductivity was discovered by Heike Karmeling Onnes when he worked with _mercury_, studying its eletrical properties at low temperatures. Using liquid helium to refrigetate mercury, Onnes discovered that at temperatures under 4.2 K (- 268.8º C) its eletrical resistence was ZERO and, increasisng the temperature, he recovered gradually its resistence.

The evolution on the discovery of other superconductor materials is a hot topic, for a different kind of materials, until nowadays (see the paper [_Room-temperature superconductivity in a carbonaceous sulfur hydride_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2801-z) or any other free examples on [arXiV](https://arxiv.org/list/cond-mat.supr-con/recent)). But it was not always true: first researchers believed that just elemental substances (as mercury, lead and niobium) were able to behave as a superconductors and really close to zero absolute temperature. Just in the 80's, cuprates (ceramic materials) were discovered exibiting the same phenomena.

A little of theory
------

### Current and eletrical resistence 

In the conduction of electricity the guys responsible to carry it are the _electrons_, the ones that comes from the metallic bonds from its atoms. In equilibrium, and in the abcense of eletric fields, they behavior randomlly and there is no current. 

At higher temperatures (room temperature, for instance) an eletric field is abble to move the electrons in some oriented direction and that is the _eletric current_. However, the termic effects leads to the excitation od the positive particles, that interferes with the movement without interruption of electrons - this is the _eletric resistence_.

When we decrease the temperature the termical effects are reduced, i.e., the thermal vibrations decrease. Ideally, the eletrical resistence would be zero only at absolute zero temperature, decreasing until it. But, this only happens in perfect cristals, because real materials have imperfections (impurities, vacancies, etc.).

### Superconductivity

#### The Cooper pairs

The superconductivity phenomena could be explained by a _condensation of electrons_, which are called **Cooper pairs**. This condensation happens with the eletrostatic interaction of the electron with the material cristal potential, that forms pairs of particles. Thus, the electrons cannot be treated as independent particles.

To make things clear, the **Cooper pairs** are pairs of electrons, and not a pair of one electron and the cristal potential. Ok...but what about the Coulomb's interaction? What happens is that, when electron interacts with the positive ions of the cristaline network (due to its higher energy), it deforms the network, being able to attract electrons with low energies around it. Yeah, finally we have our Cooper pair!

Cooper showed that two electrons, with opposite spins, are connected, creating a particle of spin zero, the **Cooper pair**. This strong correlation is a unique coherent state, insensitive to network disturbances, resulting in absence of electrical resistance, enabling superconductivity.

#### Room temperature

It is the specific temperature $T_C$, for each material, from which below it, there is the superconductivity phenomena.

#### Meissner effect

It is the repulsion of a flux of magnetic field coming from the exterior of the superconductor material, when it is presenting this property.

When we take a closer look at the lines of and external magnetic field, with temperatures above the critical one ($T > T_C$), the lines passes trought the material as passing trought vacuum. For $T < T_C$, already in the superconducting state, the expelled magnetic field forces the external magnetic field to deflect, bypass it instead of passing inside it.

### Cuprate pellet YBaCuO

The YBaCuO was discovered in 1987 for the team of the Professor C. W. Chu, in the University of Texas (the original paper could be find [here](https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.58.908)). This cuprate has $T_C = 92 K$ ($- 181 ºC$), then, it is superconductor in a temperature higher than liquid nitrogen ($T \simeq 77 K$ - 196ºC), what facilitates a lot this use.

I works as a superconductor material due to its cristaline structure in planes: there are planes with electrons of elevated mobility (like the ones of Cu-O -- the _active blocks_) and intercepted by layers with low conductivity (the _charge reservoir blocks_).

### Material production

I have made a sample of the cuprate YBa$_2$Cu$_3$0$_7$ following the pipeline (here I show my results in each stage):
- Material: powders of Y$_2$O$_3$, BaCO$_3$ and CuO;
- Stoichiometric calculation;
- Manual homogenization:

### Support and scheme

In order to test the **Meissner effect**, I have prepared a scheme to a support, allowing the **magnetic levitation** of a magnetic. The scheme consistly in:
- the superconductor pellets;
- the bead magnetic;
- a cooper support;
- a styrofoam container;
- nitrogen liquid.

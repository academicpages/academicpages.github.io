When I was fifteen my school expanded into a second building, allowing the high school to spread out, and installing empty space where there had once been gangly bundles of nervous energy. The change was particularly noticeable in the freshman hallways, now only half full compared to when it housed multiple grades. As a result, there were a lot of empty lockers, which somehow proved to be a great source of excitement.

Most commonly, the game would be to open all the lockers and run down the hall with arms outstretched, slamming them shut and infuriating the Spanish teacher whose classroom was on the other side of the wall. That one is obvious for a teenage boy. I fondly remember a situation where my classmate’s pet hamster got stuck in his car the night before, and he was only able to retrieve it during lunch break. Naturally, there was nothing to be done about this hamster until the end of the day, so it spent the afternoon in the empty row of lockers. Curiosity got the best of everyone, and the hamster, aptly named Lil Fucker, was found by administration. I distinctly remember the head of school smiling along as he handed me a detention slip on behalf of the pet rodent.

My favorite of these lockers was the first in the row of empties, meaning that it was next to a locker in use, in this case by a friend of mine. He had taken it upon himself to use it as his second locker – it was next to him and no one else needed it. He didn’t need the space, and I don’t particularly remember what he stored in it initially. Books and stolen knick knacks perhaps. But over time, we and a couple of other friends began to use it as a sort of library.

Some important context – we went to a private, religious school, a particularly conservative one from what I now understand. I mention this to let you know that some of the parents were quite strict about what sorts of media we consumed. Even at 14 and 15, some movies, books, and music would need to be hidden or risk being confiscated. This wasn’t the case for all four of us, but it had happened enough that we decided some of our more scandalous treasures would be better off at school than in a home with nosy parents.

So we added what we could, and it just kept growing. There was a director’s cut of Donnie Darko which resonated strongly with us as teenagers in a private school. There were a number of Chuck Palahniuk books, Fight Club of course, but we also loved Survivor and Choke. Wes Anderson’s Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums. Stephen Chbosky’s novel The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Scarface. A dvd of The Virgin Suicides. I believe that’s where I kept my copy of Bukowski’s Hot Water Music. There would have been some Salinger in there as well. Catcher in the Rye is a given, but I think that’s how I was introduced to Franny and Zooey as well. Camus’ The Stranger.

It’s silly now, but in 2005 physical copies of movies and music still represented some form of currency, especially to teenagers too young to work or drive. So when people found out what we were doing, they wanted in. We didn’t let just anyone look in the locker, but occasionally we would get a request and we’d lend something out. I remember my history teacher asking why I was carrying “a John Cusack movie” around after I’d just retrieved High Fidelity from a classmate. I think we developed a very minor reputation for it. I had a DVD burner (again, 2005), so I could take requests for movies to rent or download and add. I’d also find cd’s that had leaked before their release date and sell bootleg copies. You don’t see so much of that these days.

As a teenager at the time, I was trying to figure out who I was, what was cool, and how to fit them together. We all got to participate in this tight group centered around the art that we loved and sprinkled with just enough danger to make us feel cool, ignorant of that fact that no one really cared. I can’t speak for all teenagers, but for me, it helped to be able to tether my sense of self to these books and movies that I loved. “I’m the kind of guy who reads existentialist fiction instead of schoolwork,” I must have thought. It was pretentious, but largely innocent. At some point when you are trying things, you’ll wind up trying too hard. It helped me develop a passion in seeking.. And the next year, when the freshmen became sophomores and moved downstairs, we cleaned the locker out like all the others, but we kept that sense of discovery.

These other three boys were my repeated partners in crime for the rest of high school, often in ways that feel adjacent to this empty locker. We dragged a lunch table into the woods nearby to make a little sacred space instead of eating in the cafeteria. We went 2 or 3 times a week for the last year and a half to a local coffee place on the lake to burn down Turkish Golds and talk about nothing. New friends would filter in and out, each bringing a nugget to our shared knowledge. I remember writing down a more worldly friend’s movie recommendation and going to an indie movie rental place to begin my deep dive into French New Wave cinema.

Friends hang out and talk, nothing out of the ordinary there. Maybe the locker was just a vehicle for the self-discovery every high schooler is going through. I thought girls would like me if I was cultured, but now I have no idea why. Perhaps I mistakenly equated a knowledge of Russian literature with a presentation of maturity. Whoops. Nevertheless it gave me a sense of community with my fellow librarians. It gave me a sense of identity; I wanted to be someone who knew about cool stuff. And it sparked a passion for educating myself that can be hard to find for a teenager. Like a lot of students, or every student, I found much of my classwork boring, but being around classmates helped stoke my interest in learning something at least.

It’s a fond memory, one I’m no doubt recalling incorrectly in some way or another. I wish I knew how to replicate it now. Something about that particular time in my youth made me feel like I could just pick off pieces of books and movies and add them to my personality like armor, letting myself and everyone else know that I was “cultured.” As an adult, it seems impossibly pretentious to think this way. The process of learning who you are begets some period of affectation, and that’s the journey of learning who we are. We try on different hats, and we see what fits.

Maybe that process of self-discovery is what resonates with me even today. I tried on hats with my friends, and some of them fit really well. At the same I certainly didn’t think learning (or choosing) who I was to be particularly exciting. I still thought I might wind up being anyone. As an adult, it’s clear now that there are some types of people that I will never be, and I feel the slightest twinge of loss for those lives unlived. There is peace in our familiarity with ourselves. Maybe in one outcome, I would have been an astronaut. I guess we’ll never know. But maybe that would have felt a bit confining. After all, they don’t let you stash hamsters in your space station locker.

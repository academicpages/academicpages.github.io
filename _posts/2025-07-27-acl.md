Our paper *"RUBRIC-MQM : Span-Level LLM-as-judge in Machine Translation For High-End Models"* [(↗)](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-industry.12/) was presented at **ACL 2025**.

- Presenting **PROMPTCUE**, a straightforward approach for the direct meta-evaluation of LLM-as-judge models in Machine Translation.
- Upgrading the conventional MQM scoring system to assess DA at the span level using a detailed scoring rubric. This approach enhances correlation and is especially apt for assessing top-tier models.
- Pinpointing major weaknesses of **GEMBA-MQM** and rectify them by examining fundamental prompt structures.

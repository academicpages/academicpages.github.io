This evening, I led the session on Topic Modeling in the book club of Orange County R Users Group ([OCRUG](https://ocrug.org/)). The session covered contents of chapter 5 (converting to and from non-tidy formats) and chapter 6 (topic modeling) of the book [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/). All of my teaching slides and exercise materials can be found [here](https://github.com/ocrug/bookclub/tree/master/Club-07-Text_Mining_with_R/session-03-C5-6).

This is the first time I really look into Natural Language Processing (NLP) and it's fun. Although my research doesn't really need to apply NLP directly, I still found it promising especially for researchers in the field of life sciences. The burgeoning of explainable AI could make things easier for the general public to understand scientific results and NLP will play an important role in filling the gap. Maybe in one day, all patients could easily understand their brain health after brain scans via the excellent interpretation of a machine.

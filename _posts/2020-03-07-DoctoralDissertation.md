The end of my doctoral studies in electrical engineering has finally come.

The end of the cold winter
======
It has been a long process, where various family problems have increased the normal difficulty. They have been complex years with many losses. But also with a new family and love.

I consider myself a little hermit and I quite enjoy solitude. So neither family nor friends were invited to this activity. It was a calm and extensive defense, like all of them.

I am deeply grateful to my advisors and the doctoral commission, some of them had to travel from afar to be present.


The topic
======

In this work, the formulation and experimental analysis of the Optimal Sensor Placement (OSP) problem has been investigated in the context of categorical 2-D models with spatial dependence. In the mining exploration and production area, this problem attempts to find the best way of distributing measurements (or samples) to optimize sensing/locating resources in areas of mining and drilling. 

This work aims at formalizing the OSP problem for a given amount of available measurements. The characterization of the uncertainty is a central piece of this formalization.

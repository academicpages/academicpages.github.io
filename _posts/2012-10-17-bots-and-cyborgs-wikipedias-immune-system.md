My frequent collaborator Aaron Halfaker has written up a <a href="http://stuartgeiger.com/bots-cyborgs-halfaker.pdf" target="_blank">fantastic article</a> with John Riedl in _Computer_ reviewing a lot of the work we&#8217;ve done on algorithmic agents in Wikipedia, casting them as Wikipedia&#8217;s immune system. Choice quote:  &#8220;These bots and cyborgs are more than tools to better manage content quality on Wikipedia—through their interaction with humans, they’re fundamentally changing its culture.&#8221;

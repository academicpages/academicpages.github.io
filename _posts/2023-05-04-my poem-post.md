### Apple I

We are apples<br>
Not called with other names<br>
Never heard we are disparate<br>
We are apples from TREES<br>
<br>
Our<br>
Radiant reddish red<br>
Greenery greenish green<br>
Pied, mottled, spotted skin;<br>
Our inside is always yellowish white with dark seeds—<br>
Together called “APPLE” ‘gain and ‘gain<br>
<br>
Big or small, or whole or pieced<br>
Cracked or crushed or crumbled<br>
Just before swallowed<br>
Englutted through the gorge<br>
Our juicy juice and sweet smell & flavor<br>
Ours, ALWAYS!<br>
<br>
We are apples<br>
Never called differently<br>
We are apples<br>
We are apples in ONE WOODEN BOX.

I was delighted and dejected when reading [this interview](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/trump-us-politics-poor-whites/)
(titled "Trump: Tribute of Poor White People") with J. D. Vance, who wrote
[*Hillbilly Elegy*](https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547).
Vance came from a poor white family, spent time in the Marines, and is a Yale
Law graduate.

I was struck when watching the first presidential debate by the difference in
emotional content of the two candidates. Since reading [*The Political
Brain*](https://www.amazon.com/Political-Brain-Emotion-Deciding-Nation/dp/1586485733),
I'm on the look-out for how politicians connect with people's emotions. I
groaned when Hillary's first answer included the words "advanced
manufacturing". I know more about advanced manufacturing than most people, so I
expect I'm one of the few people who could even possibly be excited about such
a thing, and I was definitely not excited to hear about advanced manufacturing
in the first 30 seconds of a major debate about the future of the nation. In
contrast, Trump's first words were, "Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing
the country." *That* is quality speech-giving.

I can't bear to write only about politics, so a little Roman history: _tribune_
referred mostly famously to a Roman elected official. Early in Roman history,
only the aristocratic class could vote for elected officials. Political action,
basically massive labor strikes, gained the Roman working class the right to
vote. The tribune of the plebs was the first official that the working class,
the _plebs_, could vote for.

It's often said that the tribunes could veto legislation, which brings to mind
the US President's formal ability to refuse legislation and return it to
Congress. The tribunes' veto was different. Nowhere in the job description did
it say "tribues can veto". Instead, tribunes' physical bodies were considered
sacrosanct. This meant that attempting to harm, move, or resist a tribune was
punishable by death without a trial. (Think of the forcefield surrounding
polices' bodies that makes injuring or resisting them an extra-special crime.)

A tribune would block legislation by physically interposing
himself between voters and the voting equipment, or by putting his hands over
the mouth of someone who would give a speech. The
tribune, whose job was to protect the rights of the working class, could thus
enforce their legislative power only in a single place at a single time. This
was effective because Roman laws could only be voted on in certain places
following certain elaborate procedures: it was one city with one single polling
place. Lintott's [*Constitution of the Roman Republic*](https://www.amazon.com/Constitution-Roman-Republic-Andrew-Lintott/dp/0199261083)
is a great place to learn more.

Vance's interview and Trump's speech are good reminders about the effects of a
failure to humbly inquire and empathize. I spend a lot of time around PhDs, who
are trained to solve certain kinds of problems in certain kinds of ways. It is
tempting for people like this to think that they are smarter than others. And
because intellectuals often value intellect, this means that being smarter
means being _better_ than others.

In contrast, I think that school gives good grades to people who are good at
school, not necessarily people who are good or smart. It's easy to get lost in
that elite white people echo chamber, which says that Trump supporters are just
racist, foolish, or whatever. I had the good fortune to be, as a kid, in a Boy
Scout troop whose fathers were mostly contractors and laborers. The white
collar dads were often laughably out of place when outdoorsing, and yet somehow
ended up in a disproportionate share of leadership positions. That experience
taught me a lot, including, as Vance talks about, some humility when making
assumptions about how political opinion, intelligence, worth, agency, and
wealth are related.

.
{% sidenote 'One' 'See [tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/](https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/) and [rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html)' %} This page is an adaptation of the [Tufte Handout PDF](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/examples/tufte-handout.pdf).

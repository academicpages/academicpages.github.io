I’m glad to announce that I will be the instructor of record for [Psychology Fundamentals (PSYCH 9B/ PSCI 11B)](http://catalogue.uci.edu/allcourses/psych/) at UCI in Summer Session I. Today is the first day of my teaching. In the following 5 weeks, I will lecture on in-depth topics of general psychology including learning, memory, motivation, thought processes, language, and development.

This is the first time I teach an entire university course as an instructor. In the senior year of my undergraduate, I interned as an instructor to teach psychology in Guangzhou 10th Middle School. In the past year, I taught a few data science guided projects to the public on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/you-lilian-cheng). Both instructor experiences prepared me to teach online about psychology.

The **MT Marathon 2025** [(↗)](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/mt-marathon-2025/) was a week-long machine translation research event in 🇫🇮 **Helsinki (Aug 25–29, 2025)**, bringing together researchers, developers, and students from across Europe and beyond.  

Participation was **limited to 100 selected attendees**, and included MT lectures, labs, keynote talks, and hands-on hacking projects advancing tools and research collaborations with European peers.  

I engaged in team-oriented projects and networking with international researchers in the machine translation community.

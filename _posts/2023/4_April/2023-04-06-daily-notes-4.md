I always proclaim myself as a brave person, and I am really proud of my courage. 

During my undergraduate studies, I succeeded in some public speeches in the classroom, competitions and class activities, despite having a personality of low profile and silence, and without ever training as a public spokenman. It was my courage that supported me to fulfill these heroic undertakings. Additionally, courage also helped me in some important moments of desicion-making. 

I think my courage is deeply rooted in my childhood reading experiences. In fifth grade, I received a gift from my cousin - a book named "Legends and Myths of Ancient Greece" written by H. A. Kuhn. Different from common fairy tale books with the same theme, this book is entirely an academic translation. Despite the obscure language, I was completely fascinated by the legendary characters and stories in that remote world. My favorite god is Hermes, the god of commerce, traveller, thief, and husbandary. I always wondered how great it would be if I could have the same flying shoes! On the other hand, my favorite hero (i.e., demigod) is Heracles, who was raised to the god of Olympus after he finished his twelve great achievements. The grand narrative describing gods and heroes profoundly influenced my juvenile spirit and shaped my personality.

When a person is trapped in a dilemma, courage will be the engine that drives him away from the mire.

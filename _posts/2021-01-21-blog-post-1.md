This morning, I presented my recent research on head direction signals in the human brain to prospective interdepartmental neuroscience program (INP) PhD students. It was a 5min short presentation with 3min Q&A. I received many interesting and diverse questions from prospective students and also learned about my colleagues' cool research through their presentations. I hope many young and energetic 'brains' will join the UCI neuroscience community in the coming year!

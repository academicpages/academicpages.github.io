1. We need to extract the file.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d15982d-19e0-405f-ba7b-34518f7f5c88)<br>

2. While examining the `Windows\PowerShell.evtx` file, I discovered a password.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61555adc-ce8d-4ace-88a7-3bb84970901f)<br>

3. Next, I tried to open the `storageM.img` file and used the password I found.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ac7f50a-5754-4e0d-aa2c-07e941821172)<br>

4. After successfully entering the password, I checked my disks and found a new one named `ihack-data`.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c1d5f9f-41c2-4132-a501-16930d0e82c6)<br>

5. Finally, I opened the `flag.txt` file on the new disk and retrieved the content.<br>

## Splunk-1<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c25d35c-aec6-4eff-988a-15e9f3e1cef6)<br>

1. Upon analyzing the logon events, I discovered that the admin was being attacked by the IP address `192.168.8.41`.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9c56780-91bb-4ad9-9bdd-51504aab5b39)<br>

2. I searched in the Sysmon host and source IP and found that the host IP is `192.168.8.52`.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06db029d-3bb3-4d7d-b1af-3b94a2f634d9)<br>

3. So I tried the flag in `ihack24{admin:192.168.8.52}`.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/146cdebf-2b68-416a-8040-31a95e605ab8)<br>

## Splunk-2<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad437409-624a-401c-9de0-672baef0185a)<br>

1. Based on Splunk-1, I found the attacker's IP is `192.168.8.41`, so this is the flag: `ihack24{192.168.8.41}`.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51b36278-80f5-4d1e-8dc2-9bfd5ec32fb5)<br>

## Splunk-3<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/788bee36-a3eb-4c76-b530-69e99737fe9c)<br>

1. I searched for the earliest time for logon.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75c6b808-3914-48a7-ba69-a685a522b6f0)<br>

2. I checked the event to get the time.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20a58706-d2ad-42cf-936a-4635da38cb3e)<br>

3. So the flag is:<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28542106-9641-4378-8391-802f993aa266)<br>

2. Based on the previous answer, I found a command executed at 09:57:20 PM, which was `systeminfo`.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0e83baf-953f-4e97-bd83-9ddb6d41c16f)<br>

3. So, I guessed it is the flag:<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/748c914d-a63d-4ac0-894b-44ea6df9fbd5)<br>

1. When I tried to find Splunk-8, I saw some IP addresses in the payload.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc1c5d9a-f1fc-43ff-9e9d-37ac8d173743)<br>

2. So, I tried the IP and found it was the flag:<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fed3b845-fad6-4c9f-9659-cfb25c63fe93)<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4975f59f-f8c4-459f-8a99-fe27ab07ff28)<br>

1. I searched by IP backdoor: `157.230.33.7`.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10c411af-64b3-43de-b041-1deaa8dcceb6)<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8937bae6-c278-495d-96e4-37c42bfe43b7)<br>

2. So I got the flag: `ihack24{nmap.exe}`.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd07caa6-db76-407b-8f14-a3e28ce70be5)<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd307a86-5cb0-4de9-8d85-f9b4f63c2c28)<br>

2. I filtered by `operator` and saw a password in the PowerShell event: `operator123`.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19f0b15f-8ff7-43e1-a9a3-9692ed9f56d3)<br>

<br>

2. I saw some commands in the event and found the backdoor IP, so I guessed the command line is the flag.<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c69216f1-405b-4a5d-a646-0c43a03a1fcc)<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bc64976-feaf-4279-936e-1dd07f7836f0)<br>

1.Unzip the file <br>
<img width="78" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e1e71bd-3c2e-49b8-871e-69d4983363c6"><br>

2.Then you can ﬁnd the dll ﬁle then use dnspy to run the dll ﬁle<br>
<img width="436" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53fe2aba-5143-42be-baab-6c8d1d509887"><br>

3.Then go to form 1 @020000002 then you can ﬁnd the hint for the ﬂag `“  this.lblMessage.Te x t = "License Key is valid. Flag is ihack24{(the license key)}";”` <br>
<img width="959" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f1ad19f-e861-46de-8eec-cf167de34f08"><br>

4.The SecretKey function is used in the given C# code to produce the licensing key. This technique uses an XOR operation between the characters of a key string ("secret") and a hidden string `("BRQFHF@WR_+6,N:$78")` to get the correct licensing key.<br>
<img width="739" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e3e4792-c042-44d7-88f5-40578932182c"><br>

5.So just create a small Python script that mimics the SecretKey method from the C# code.<br>
<img width="700" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6c835b2-cb80-4528-871d-250e293b1efc"><br>

6.To make sure this is the correct ﬂag just copy the license key and paste at “crackme.exe”<br>
<img width="401" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1de30192-1926-4fe9-9b79-14b9021f52d2"><br>

7.That is the flag.<br>

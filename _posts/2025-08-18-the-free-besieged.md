<article class="article-container">


    <p>Midday in late July. The place is boiling. I've stepped out for a break in the university courtyard—which, admittedly, is more reminiscent of an abandoned prison. My only escape is the music in my headphones, and my only companions are the stray dogs wandering about. The fifteen minutes of my break have passed, and I'm getting ready to leave.</p>
    
    <p>A slight, wandering man is pushing his bicycle on the opposite side, followed by two four-legged friends he has obviously just fed. Short and lean, unkempt, with long, tangled hair, scorched by the sun. He looks homeless. He approaches the area where I am, and I instinctively turn my gaze elsewhere.</p>
    
    <p>He starts talking to me. I can't hear him, but I suspect he might want something from me. I have, however, judged him wrongly in advance. Taking off my headphones, I hear:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>"Social compromise is a set of explicit and implicit agreements between the main social and economic classes of a society..."</p>
        <p>"Excuse me?"</p>
        <p>"What I mean is that, unfortunately, we are all forced to live in a permanent state of compromise."</p>
        <p>"I agree, but isn't that an inseparable part of our lives?"</p>
        <p>"‘They’ have passed it on to us so subliminally that we take it for granted, when in reality it isn't."</p>
        <p>"You're confusing me. Who do you define as 'they,' and why would they want to impose this on us?"</p>
        <p>"The System, because it suits it."</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>After this answer, I begin to perceive his leftist nature. The signs clearly point me in that direction. I even reach such a point of certainty that I expect him at any moment to hand me a party leaflet and recite the regurgitated ideas of political factions. And yet, I was once again spectacularly wrong. Appearance is in complete opposition to reality. To understand just how off my assessment was, I only want you to consider that in our nearly two-hour conversation, we never once mentioned parties or politicians. Instead, we discussed so many different, interesting topics: from modern man's alienated relationship with nature, to the moral role of the scientist, and ancient Greece—the mother of the modern way of thinking. His knowledge was analytical, his views well-documented, his passion for dialogue intense, and his spirit wide open to every new stimulus...</p>
    
    <p>But it was the small details that caught my attention and stood out. When asked what he does for a living, he replied: "I once studied economics and I liked psychology. Now, I do whatever comes up here and there." When I suggested we sit down nearby so we wouldn't be standing, he refused, seeking a place with more green and shade. He told me about his nightly excursions into nature on his bicycle and how he frequents Metsovo and the Aoos Springs Lake, which calms him. I asked him why he strikes up conversations with strangers, and he answered: "Because I continue to believe in people. Even from those who mock me, I have something to learn from their reaction." To my question of whether he ever doubts his worldview, he said: "We all more or less believe in a lie. We find it hard to accept that. But I try to choose—as much as I possibly can—my own."</p>
    
    <p>In the eyes of most of us, this man's way of life seems—I'll try to put this as politely as possible—a failure. Someone who could have potentially built a very respectable family and professional life has "ended up" being neither professionally accomplished, nor well-groomed in appearance, nor socially accepted. And the most paradoxical thing for the many of us: all this, not out of necessity but by choice, without being mentally worn down, or physically or psychologically ill. His story disappoints us, not just for the "fall" itself, which is problematic, but because it's the "fall" from the mountain top that makes it utterly disheartening.</p>
    
    <p>And yet, as oxymoronic as it may sound, this man—a blend of Diogenes the Cynic and Thoreau the Transcendentalist—has something that all of us, the "normal" ones, desperately lack. Something that one obviously wouldn't imagine at first glance, or even after a brief chat with him about some mundane, everyday topic. Something that, no matter how hard I've tried in my life so far to understand what it is, I've never been able to define. I couldn't discover it even when I did everything that seemed logical: I chased and achieved goals on all levels, which were supposed—as I had been promised—not to leave me unfulfilled. If there are moments when you catch yourself wondering why your life isn't as happy, interesting, and full of meaning as you'd like, and it sometimes ends up becoming dull, monotonous, and empty, then you are reading the right article. Thanks to this chance encounter, I am now much closer to understanding the "why" of the previous question. With a little research and reading, I am also slowly approaching the "how." But to your misfortune, this doesn't mean I guarantee solutions—like yet another self-help guru—that will necessarily work in your case, fulfilling utopian scenarios of eternal happiness. If, however, you enjoy reading, are even slightly enticed by challenges, and are content with the certainty that you will learn fascinating truths about who you truly are as human beings, then fasten your seatbelts because the journey is about to begin...</p>

    <h3>Our Factory Settings</h3>
    
    <p>We are born without choosing it. Without having the slightest ability to choose our gender, the color of our eyes, our hair, or our skin. More importantly, it is not up to us to choose even more decisive characteristics: whether we will be blind or deaf, whether we will manage to breathe at first or later to walk, or even whether we will survive a congenital disease. And if all this seems somewhat obvious to you, the influence of the genome we inherit is enormous, and it is not limited only to physical characteristics but extends to our very personality. What would you say if I told you that every time we declare that we chose, entirely on our own, to be "open-minded" or "organized," we are sorely mistaken, since for about half of it, someone else has long since chosen for us?</p>
    
    <p>The influence of the genome on the formation of character is now scientifically proven. Specifically, modern psychology defines five fundamental dimensions of personality, known as the "Big Five Personality Traits." Studies on twins have shown that an impressive percentage, almost half (40-60%), of the differences we observe between people in these five traits can be attributed to genetic factors. These, partly predetermined, "factory settings" of ours are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Openness to Experience:</b> Our natural inclination towards curiosity, imagination, art, and the search for new ideas. It is one of the most strongly heritable traits, determining how open we are to change and the unknown.</li>
        <li><b>Conscientiousness:</b> Our innate predisposition for discipline, organization, persistence, and goal-orientation. It is the biological basis of our capacity for hard work and self-control.</li>
        <li><b>Extraversion:</b> Our biological tendency to be sociable, talkative, assertive, and to draw energy from social contact, as opposed to introversion.</li>
        <li><b>Agreeableness:</b> Our natural inclination towards compassion, kindness, trust, and cooperation with others.</li>
        <li><b>Neuroticism:</b> Our genetic sensitivity to experiencing negative emotions such as anxiety, fear, sadness, and anger. It is the opposite of emotional stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But what does all this mean in practice? It means that these five categories are not simple labels, but the invisible forces that shape our automatic reactions and our deepest preferences. They act like a powerful, internal current that, although it doesn't completely determine our course, exerts a constant, unseen pressure. Someone with high Neuroticism doesn't consciously choose to be anxious; their brain is simply biologically wired to react more intensely to potential threats. A person with low Conscientiousness isn't inherently lazy; they just need to exert a great deal more conscious effort to stay organized compared to someone who has organization in their "factory settings" manual. Simply put, our genetic predisposition defines the amount of energy we must expend to exhibit specific behaviors. Its influence is felt in the daily grind, in that inexplicable feeling of "swimming against the current" when our job, relationships, or goals demand that we be someone who, deep down—biologically—we are not.</p>

    <hr>
    
    <h3>The Power of the Non-Shared Environment</h3>

    <p>And because I know that some of you would rightly want to play "devil's advocate," challenging the idea that we are only our biology, I hasten to preempt you: this factor, although decisive, is not the only one. But if only half of our personality is due to our genetic heritage, what determines the rest? This is precisely where research has revealed its most unconventional finding. The remaining percentage (which also accounts for potential measurement error) is not, surprisingly, determined by the "shared environment"—that is, the factors that should theoretically make siblings growing up in the same family resemble each other (e.g., their interactions, upbringing, socioeconomic status). For example, two siblings growing up in the same family with high expectations for their education may both become doctors—an outcome clearly influenced by the shared environment—but end up with completely different personalities. One may become the "selfish" doctor, interpreting family pressure as a need for prestige and wealth, while the other becomes the "humble" doctor, interpreting it as a motivation to serve humanity. This difference doesn't stem from the family, but from how each one's unique psyche interacted with their personal experiences, their friends, and the random events of their lives.</p>
    
    <p>The other half of our personality is essentially sculpted by the "non-shared environment." The factors of the non-shared environment, as confirmed by research, are the unique, idiosyncratic experiences that make us different from our siblings, and include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>Different Social Circles:</b> The friendships each child forms constitute a powerful, unique environment that shapes their behavior and values.</li>
        <li><b>Unique Relationship with Parents:</b> Even in the same family, the relationship each parent develops with each child is unique and evolves differently.</li>
        <li><b>Random Events:</b> An accident, an illness, a specific teacher who inspired them, or a lucky opportunity.</li>
        <li><b>Subjective Interpretation:</b> This is the most powerful factor. Two siblings may experience the exact same event, but how they interpret it and incorporate it into their story depends on their own, unique psychological "filter." The environment is not what happens to us, but what it means to us.</li>
    </ul>

    <hr>
    
    <h3>The Brain as Director</h3>

    <p>In the early stages of life, an individual cannot choose their friendships, their relationship with their parents, nor, certainly, their luck. We thus conclude that the only field where one can exert influence in shaping their personality is that of subjective interpretation. But what exactly do we define as subjective interpretation, and how can it grant us, even partially, the ability to self-shape?</p>
    
    <p>We define subjective interpretation as precisely this internal, personal mechanism by which each individual "translates" objective reality into a personal experience. At this point, the concept of subjective interpretation is inextricably linked to the idea of free will, not as identical concepts, but as cause and effect. In other words, the unique interpretation an individual gives to an event is what creates the field for them to exercise their free will in how they will react to it. Without subjective interpretation, there is no free will. This dynamic relationship places the individual in the position of an active creator rather than a passive recipient. It transfers the locus of control from external, predetermined factors (genes, random events) to an internal, personal space, where personality is no longer a static outcome but a continuous and dynamic process.</p>
    
    <p>And yet, how truly sovereign are we within this internal, personal space? Is this field of subjective interpretation an impregnable fortress where our will operates uninfluenced? Modern research comes to complicate the picture, revealing that even this last bastion of our autonomy is surprisingly permeable. The world we see is not real. It is not an objective recording of reality, but a masterfully edited film, directed and cut by our brain in real time. The very sense of "now" is a well-crafted illusion. Think about it: only a tiny area of our visual field, the size of a postage stamp, is truly in high definition. All the rest is blurry. The fact that we don't perceive it this way is due to an amazing trick. Our eyes perform 3-4 abrupt movements per second, the so-called saccadic movements, scanning the environment. During these movements, to prevent us from seeing a blurry, dizzying image, the brain simply "switches off" our vision. This means that if we add up all these blank intervals of vision, we calculate that for about two hours every day, we are literally blind. This time does not remain empty; the brain fills it with the best possible guesses about what happened in the dark.</p>
    
    <p>The challenge to the concept of self-willed interpretation becomes even more radical when we examine the very moment of decision. The neuroscientist Benjamin Libet, in the 1980s, conducted an experiment that shook the foundations of philosophy. He asked participants to look at a special clock and press a button whenever they decided to, noting the exact moment they felt the conscious "urge" to act. Simultaneously, he recorded their brain activity. He discovered that the brain activity preparing the movement (the so-called "readiness potential") began about half a second before the participants consciously felt they had made the decision.</p>

    <p>This unsettling picture became even more extreme decades later. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the team of neuroscientist John-Dylan Haynes not only managed to confirm Libet's findings but to extend them to an almost unimaginable time depth. Their research showed that they could predict which button (left or right) a participant would press up to ten whole seconds before the participant themselves became aware of their decision, by observing activity in deeper brain regions associated with planning. In other words, our brain not only decides but begins to prepare a specific decision long before we have the slightest idea. Our subjective interpretation of the moment ("Now I choose to press the button") seems less like a general's command and more like a press secretary's announcement, simply informing us of a decision already made behind closed doors.</p>
    
    <p>The brain is not a passive recorder of time; it is a skillful director. When you stir milk into your coffee, the sound of the spoon hitting the cup reaches your ears in 1.2 milliseconds, the sensation of warmth on your fingers in 50 milliseconds, and the light from the image to your eyes in just 1.3 nanoseconds. Three completely different signals that reach the brain at different times. And yet, you do not experience them asynchronously. You experience them as a single, unified, simultaneous moment. This happens because the brain waits to collect all the data and then creates a unified version of the past, which it presents to you as the "present." What you feel as "now" is, in reality—as Libet and Haynes proved—a story about what happened seconds before. But the falsification doesn't stop there. To survive, the brain shows us not only the past but a prediction of the future. A professional ping-pong player could never return a serve if they saw where the ball was 100 milliseconds ago. Instead, their brain calculates the ball's speed and trajectory and shows them a fictional version of it at the point where it predicts it will be in the immediate future. Our conscious experience is not reality, but a prediction.</p>
    
    <p>The most amazing proof of this innate capacity for interpretation comes from situations where the senses fall completely silent. Even in patients in a comatose state, seemingly cut off from the world, the brain does not cease to create meaning. In a series of pioneering studies, neuroscientist Adrian Owen managed to communicate with patients in a vegetative state. Using fMRI, he asked a patient to imagine herself playing tennis. Immediately, the areas of her brain related to movement (the supplementary motor area) activated, just as in a healthy person. When he asked her to imagine herself walking through her house, the areas related to spatial navigation activated. The patient, although trapped in a motionless body, could hear, understand, and perform a conscious act of interpretation, answering questions by changing her mental state. This proves that the need to give meaning and create a personal interpretation is not just a psychological function; it is the very essence of consciousness, an innate force that survives even when the external world has fallen silent.</p>
    
    <p>Psychologist John Bargh, a pioneer in the study of the unconscious, demonstrated with a series of brilliant experiments how easily "our" interpretation can be manipulated. In one of his most famous experiments, participants, on their way to the lab, held a researcher's cup of coffee for a few seconds. For one group the coffee was hot, for the other it was iced. Immediately after, they read a description of a neutral person and were asked to evaluate them. The results were revealing: those who held the hot coffee interpreted the person as significantly "warmer," more generous, and friendly. A fleeting, random physical sensation had shaped their supposedly personal judgment, without any of them realizing it.</p>
    
    <p>This unconscious influence is not limited to simple sensations. It penetrates deeper, activating entire cultural stereotypes that shape not only our interpretation but also our behavior. In another landmark experiment by Bargh, participants formed sentences from scrambled words. For one group, the words were neutral. For the other, they contained words unconsciously associated with the stereotype of the elderly (e.g., "Florida," "wrinkle," "lonely"). The measurement wasn't taken during the task, but after. Researchers secretly timed how long it took participants to walk down the hallway leaving the lab. Those who had been exposed to the elderly-related words walked significantly slower. Their interpretation of "how I should move now" had been shaped by a stereotype that was activated without their knowledge. How, then, can we claim that our interpretation is exclusively our own, when a simple word on a page can change the pace of our walk?</p>
    
    <p>The most devastating revelation, however, about the nature of our interpretive mechanism comes from the research of Michael Gazzaniga on "split-brain" patients. In these patients, the two hemispheres of the brain do not communicate. When researchers gave a command ("Walk") only to the right hemisphere—which does not control speech—the patient would get up and walk. When they asked the patient—whose speech is controlled by the left hemisphere—"Why did you get up?", the left hemisphere had no idea about the command that had been given. But instead of answering "I don't know," the brain did something magical and terrifying at the same time: it immediately invented a plausible, but completely false, story to justify the action. It would say, for example, "Oh, I want to go to the kitchen to get a soda." Gazzaniga named this mechanism in the left hemisphere "The Interpreter." Its job is not to find the objective truth, but to create a coherent and logical narrative, even if it has to construct lies. This leaves us with a chilling question: when we interpret the events of our own lives, how sure can we be that the story we tell ourselves is the truth, and not just the most convenient fiction our "Interpreter" has created to make us feel in control?</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h3>The Liberation of Acceptance</h3>

    <p>The presentation of all this research, from the unconscious influences of the environment to the decisions our brain makes seconds before we do, is not intended to terrify you, nor to disarm you of the subjective interpretation that is the last piece we control—to some extent—in the formation of our personality. On the contrary, it aims at liberation. We must recognize the role of the unconscious mind not as an enemy, but as a powerful, silent ally, essential for our very survival. Every second, our senses are bombarded with millions of bits of information, of which our consciousness can process only a few dozen. The unconscious is the mechanism that manages 99.9% of reality to allow us to focus on the tiny fraction we can handle consciously. It is not a prison; it is the foundation upon which our conscious experience is built.</p>
    
    <p>And this is precisely where salvation lies. The admission that our subjective interpretation is neither so personal nor entirely free—but partly predetermined or random—is not a defeat. It is a profound act of compassion and realism towards ourselves. It is the acceptance that we are what we are as a product of countless circumstances we never chose. And within this acceptance, our true strength is born. When we stop wasting energy fighting our own nature, we gain the clarity to see who we truly are. Thus comes the understanding of which of our predispositions we can cultivate, which battles are worth fighting, and which are entirely impossible for us to counter. Yes, our action may be on autopilot, controlled by the brain. But in the end, isn't "we"—this illusion of the brain—the only tool we know we have to grasp whatever exists?</p>

    <hr>
    
    <h3>The Silent Adjudicator Called Luck</h3>

    <p>Consider a characteristic example of how circumstances determine our lives and how we are called to accept them, not passively, but mainly to avoid unequal struggles. The human mind lacks the ability to understand the role of luck in its life; it thinks that whatever it has achieved is necessarily the product of personal superiority, hard work, and/or unique talent. This blindness is not even a matter of arrogance, but a deeply rooted cognitive bias, the so-called "egocentric bias." We experience and remember our own efforts in vivid detail, while the efforts of others remain largely invisible. Research has shown that when spouses are asked to estimate the percentage of household chores they do, the sum almost always exceeds 100%. Even more revealingly, the same happens when they are asked about how many fights they start: the sum is again over 100%. We overestimate our contribution to both the positive and the negative, simply because our own experience is the only one we fully live. This same psychological weakness is what makes us ignore our most silent and invisible collaborator: pure luck.</p>
    
    <p>Let's examine the case of professional hockey players in Canada. If you ask one of them about the secret of their success, they will talk about endless hours of practice, their parents' dedication, their discipline. They will never mention the enormous luck of being born in January. And yet, statistically, almost 40% of players selected for the top youth leagues are born in the first quarter of the year, compared to just 10% born in the last. The reason? The cutoff date for age categories is January 1st. A child born at the beginning of the year is simply a little older, stronger, and more mature. This initial, random advantage leads to more ice time, better coaching, and more attention, creating a phenomenon of "cumulative advantage" that turns a small, random difference into a huge superiority in the future. The same applies in extremely competitive environments, like the selection of NASA astronauts. A simulation showed that even if luck played only a 5% role in selection, 9 or 10 out of the 11 successful candidates would be different people if the factor of luck were completely eliminated. When the competition is fierce and everyone is talented, luck is not just a factor; it is the deciding one.</p>
    
    <p>This luck, however, is not limited to birth dates but extends to the very lottery of life. The most decisive circumstance of all is the country in which we are born, a factor that explains almost half of the variation in global income. No matter how talented and hardworking you are, if you have the misfortune of being born in Burundi, where the average annual income is $730, your chances of becoming rich are almost nil. The tragedy is that this ignorance of luck also has moral consequences. In one experiment, a group of three people was asked to solve a problem, with one of them randomly designated as the "leader." When the researcher brought four cookies at the end, the fourth, extra cookie was almost always taken by the randomly chosen leader, feeling they deserved it. In another study, participants who were prompted to think they achieved something thanks to their own abilities donated 25% less money to charity compared to those who were prompted to think about the external factors that helped them. The illusion of control and personal superiority not only blinds us to reality but also makes us less generous, undermining the very social structures that enabled our success.</p>

    <hr>
    
    <h3>The Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are</h3>
    
    <p>This realization, that our success is so deeply intertwined with external factors, is merely the first crack in a much larger illusion: the illusion that there is even an "I" as a separate entity to succeed or fail in the first place. This very truth, the great "taboo against knowing who you are," was explored in depth by the philosopher Alan Watts. The feeling that we are an isolated self, enclosed in a "bag of skin," is the most powerful and destructive hallucination of our culture. The truth is that the "inside" and the "outside"—genetics and environment—are not two different things, but the two poles of a single, indivisible process. For this "I" reading these lines to exist, an unbroken chain of ancestors—stretching back to the beginning of life—was needed, who faced debilitating conditions and diseases. It required the explosion of giant stars to forge the carbon and iron atoms that make up our bodies. We are, literally, stardust that has become conscious. We are the sensory apparatus of the universe, the point at which the universe becomes aware of its own, intricate beauty.</p>
    
    <p>Just think about this: random electromagnetic radiation, through our nervous system, is translated into colors. The periodic vibrations of air molecules are translated into music that stirs emotions in us. Our body is not even "our own"; it is an entire, living ecosystem for trillions of microorganisms. Our very identity is shaped in relation to every other person, every animal, every plant. The universe becomes the "I," and the "I" the universe. Without the "other," the concept of "I" does not exist. Understanding this indivisible unity doesn't just make us less selfish; it negates the very concept of the self as an autonomous unit.</p>
    
    <p>And if all this sounds like an abstract, Eastern philosophy, what would a person who lived, even instinctively, with this understanding look like? The answer, paradoxically, can be found not in some serene sage, but in the person of Charles Bukowski. His famous exhortation, now his epitaph, "Don't Try," is not a hymn to laziness. It is the ultimate rejection of the ego's effort to impose a false, ideal version of itself. It is a command to stop fighting what you are and to allow the totality of your organism—what Watts would call the real, undivided Self—to express itself. Bukowski refused to play the game of the social mask. He embraced and expressed his raw, unfiltered truth, with all its failures, addictions, and ugliness. He did not try to "fix" himself according to social "shoulds." This radical acceptance of his random package was what unleashed his immense creative energy.</p>

    <p>Returning to our own "Bukowski," time had passed, and I had to get back to work. I had the feeling that, while we had said so much, something still remained. Then I remembered. We hadn't said our names. I started first, reminding him that we hadn't introduced ourselves:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p>"Before we leave, let's say our names."</p>
        <p>"The real ones, or should we imagine what they are?"</p>
        <p>"I have nothing to hide. My name is Apostolis."</p>
        <p>"Alright, then. Odysseus. It was a pleasure."</p>
        <p>"I also enjoyed our conversation. Goodbye."</p>
        <p>"Goodbye."</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>We said our farewells without trying to stay in touch. We said that if our paths were fated to cross again one day, it would happen on its own. His question about the truth of our names troubled me. What could his name truly mean to him? A bad memory from his "previous" life? Something that others chose for him, without ever asking? Or perhaps an admission that we are unable to define exclusively on our own even our name, our most personal "lie"?</p>
    
    <p>As I left, I felt that I had found that "something" I had been missing for so long. The thing that no aspect of conventional success teaches us: the relief that comes when you abandon the exhausting task of defending a fictional, isolated self—a self defined by the "wants" of others—and instead allow yourself to be what you have always been: a unique, random, and inseparable expression of the universe itself. Something authentic. As for Odysseus, the only thing certain is that—unlike us—he chose to be where he is.</p>

        <p>He would be pleased if we summarized with the following Cavafian verse: "And if you find her poor, Ithaca has not deceived you. Wise as you have become, with so much experience, you must already have understood what these Ithacas mean..."</p>

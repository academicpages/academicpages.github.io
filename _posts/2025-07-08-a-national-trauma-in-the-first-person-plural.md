            <div class="article-meta">Published: July 08, 2025</div>
            <hr>

            <p>Monday, June 2, 2025, Paris. Having finished the last exam of my finals two weeks ago, I now have all the time in the world to devote to the subject of my summer internship, which focuses on a fascinating amalgam of mathematical ideas and physical reality within the framework of General Relativity. And yet, as I begin to study, an inexplicable restlessness prevents my mind from concentrating. An unexpected anguish that, over time, morphs into a soul-crushing anxiety, rendering me incapable not only of soothing it, but more importantly, of rationalizing it, interpreting it, and identifying the mechanism that triggers it. Who would have thought that, after hours of contemplation and ruling out all possible culprits, a random glance at the date on my phone screen would provide the answer: it was the starting day of the Panhellenic Exams in Greece!</p>

            <p>It would not be unreasonable for one to wonder how the administration of a Mathematics exam in Greece could negatively affect the psychological state of a university student in France. Someone who has no contact whatsoever with the Greek educational system and whose professional career is already far removed from Greece. Even more so when this person was, just the previous year, a top-scoring student of that very system, admitted to the highest-ranking department of his scientific field (the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens). A school he decided not to attend, choosing instead to move abroad to pursue his dream in theoretical-mathematical physics research, at a university that is second to none (the University of Paris-Saclay, ranked no. 12 in the world on the 2024 Shanghai Ranking and contributing to 15% of France's research activity). Even if so many facts seem to contradict this reality, it persists: during the 2024 Panhellenic Exams, he did not feel the anxiety he feels now at the mere mention of them, at the thought of them, at the memory of their existence...</p>
            
            <p>The "heavy and unbearable" name of the Panhellenic Exams haunts even the most talented and disciplined young Greek who are, in theory "invulnerable", creating a nightmare in their minds over an institution that, if you think about it, is nothing more than a simple four-day examination process. Of course, the scar it leaves on their consciousness, etched by years of silent preparation, is so deep that it is no longer in their hands to not feel anxious, to not be terrified, whether they fail or succeed, whether the exams are approaching or are long past.</p>

            <p>I could use frightening terms to describe this phenomenon, like "brainwashing" or "psychological manipulation," but I believe the one that best fits all the conditions is this:</p>

            <blockquote class="definition">
                <p><strong>Internalized Social Anxiety:</strong> a psychological state in which an individual experiences extreme fear and pressure regarding a socially supercharged event, not because of the event's inherent difficulty, but because of its long-standing cultural construction as a "trial of a lifetime."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>And the data confirms it. Research by the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (EKPA) in 2023 found that 73% of students report feeling intense or excessive anxiety during their final year of high school, and that 1 in 4 students exhibits symptoms of depression during the preparation period. In the two-year run-up to the exams, the student is constantly faced with complex scientific concepts, difficult combinatorial problems, and demanding timed tests, yet is never truly discouraged by the escalating level of difficulty or the growing demands of studying. What makes them tremble during those four three-hour sessions in June is the illusion that has been built in their minds about the immense stakes of the exams. It is the fear of failure, not the expectation of success, that overwhelms them. In a 2022 survey by diaNEOsis, one in two parents answered that they would be "very" or "quite" disappointed if their child were an average student (note, not a "poor" student, but "average"). This view contradicts the common sense notion that in a hierarchical, competitive educational system, the number of average and weak students will inevitably far exceed the number of good ones. And they have taken care to instill this aversion to mediocrity in the child subconsciously, long before they have even left the cradle (the "they" refers not only to parents, as you will see, though this does not diminish their responsibility).</p>

            <hr>

            <p>After a creative day of research for my internship, now physically present at the university in Ioannina, I sit carefree at the edge of a small neighborhood park, gazing at the sunset over the city's rooftops. At some point, nearby, two mothers bump into each other while their young children play in the open space. They greet each other, and the following exchange begins:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>-- How did Miltos do?</p>
                <p>-- Terribly, terribly, don't even ask...</p>
                <p>-- Don't worry, dear, not everyone is cut out for academia. There's a path for everyone, he'll find something to do... My son, Christakis, he excelled. We ranked third.</p>
                <p>-- Oh, congratulations, well done! Yours turned out sharp, he must have gotten it from his father, the doctor. I hope your little girl does just as well.</p>
                <p>-- And I hope your little one doesn't put you through this again. But what about Miltos? Were you paying for private tutoring?</p>
                <p>-- We were, we were...</p>
                <p>-- Mmm, so he didn't do well. Never mind, dear, there's always next year, next year...</p>
                <p>-- Yes, next year.</p>
                <p>-- For us, of course, the money we spent on Christakis wasn't wasted. Thankfully, he was gifted, you know...</p>
                <p>-- That's how it is, that's how it is...</p>
                <p>Silence...</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>I doubt there is a single citizen in Greece who has not heard (or even had) the same or a similar conversation. A conversation like any other daily chat, yet one that possesses, unbeknownst to its participants, a chilling ability to mirror the psyche of an entire nation. It is a whole mechanism of social pressure condensed into a few phrases, a pulse that every Greek has been receiving relentlessly from a very young age. I challenge you to read carefully, not the words, but the signals being transmitted. Notice the first-person plural, the "we excelled," the "we made it," which transforms the child's individual effort into a collective family trophy. Observe the almost genetic attribution of success to the "sharp" one who "got it from his father," a convenient explanation that renders the other child's failure an inherent, personal inadequacy. See the cold accounting of the tutoring fees that "weren't wasted," turning education into an investment and the student into a stock market share. Even the subtle irony and condescension ("Don't worry, dear, not everyone is cut out for academia") or the appeal to the divine ("there's a path for everyone") are significant. What you are reading is not a simple conversation. It is the live broadcast of the social trial that haunts our children's dreams, the public validation of the fear of failure, and the silent admission that in this system, it is not enough to try; you are obligated to win (or, if you didn't get the "right" gene, as they believe, to lose).</p>

            <hr>

            <p>According to the highest legal source, the Constitution of Greece, in Article 16, paragraph 2:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"Education constitutes a basic mission of the State and shall have as its purpose the <strong>moral</strong> (<em>when incidents of beatings and bullying are reported daily?</em>), <strong>intellectual</strong> (<em>when Latin is still an examination subject in 2025?</em>), <strong>professional</strong> (<em>when we choose physics, chemistry, and biology without ever having conducted a single experiment?</em>) and <strong>physical</strong> (<em>with the 'just take a ball and play' approach?</em>) education of all Greeks, the development of their national and religious consciousness and their formation into free and responsible citizens."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Law 1566/1985, which for decades formed the backbone of primary and secondary education, further specifies (oh, the irony that awaits us again) this constitutional purpose. According to Article 1:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"The purpose of primary and secondary education is to contribute to the <strong>all-round</strong> (<em>by choosing a 'misfit' counter-intuitive subject in the final year?</em>), <strong>harmonious</strong> (<em>when for two whole years, after 6 hours of school, you attend at least 2 hours of private tutoring and are also expected to study for the next day?</em>) and <strong>balanced</strong> (<em>when from the first year of high school you're told to 'drop' anything you won't choose in your final year?</em>) development of the students' intellectual and psychosomatic faculties so that, irrespective of gender and origin, they may have the opportunity to evolve into <strong>integrated</strong> (<em>when you enter the classroom and your role-model teacher discusses nothing but hyper-specialized exam topics, if that?</em>) personalities and to live <strong>creatively</strong> (<em>perhaps the closest we've come to creativity is choosing it as the topic for the Panhellenic essay?</em>)."</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <hr>

            <p>The purpose of this article is neither to convey an anti-government or anti-establishment message against educational policy or the institution of the Panhellenic Exams (an institution that is now timeless and trans-governmental, having been in place for 42 years), nor to propose superficial, café-style solutions (because you will start with the root of all evil: "we don't have the money...") to a multi-faceted problem that has now acquired a self-feeding, parasitic nature, with roots in the Greek mentality itself. Do not forget that the author is merely a non-partisan, concerned young person (from the positive sciences, no less, not the educational sciences) and not an "all-knowing" expert outside his field of study, or a person of power with selfish interests and propagandistic ambitions. And for those to whom all this sounds, at best, unfamiliar and, at worst, fantastical, because they or their children were fortunate enough to attend private or model schools, the answer is simple. My testimony comes from the "other Greece": from a small, mountainous village, Metsovo. And no, its historical significance or its tourist label does not change in the slightest the fact that its educational standard, like in countless other parts of the country, is deficient.</p>

            <p>I highlight these problems and I write because, for me, Greece is not a lost cause (as, believe me, it could have been and is for many Greeks abroad). I write because I may have "escaped" the system, but that doesn't mean I don't feel fear and injustice for what my siblings, my friends, my fellow citizens, and all young people in general are going through. I write because whoever remains silent in the face of a crime while witnessing it is an accomplice. I write because it is the least I can do to feel that I am helping. But above all, I write because I admire and embrace the Socratic maieutic method, not the now-widespread Machiavellian one...</p>

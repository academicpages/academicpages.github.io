I’m glad that our team, PawPaw Therapeutics, is the 1st place winner of the Business Pitch Competition 2021 organized by [UCI Beall Applied Innovation](https://innovation.uci.edu/) and [GPS-STEM](https://gps.bio.uci.edu/)! Our team is made up of me and other six biology PhD students and postdoc. We started with a medical research discovery, developed it into a business idea as a new type of cancer therapy, and pitched a business canvas to judges. This time, I gained industry insights as a STEM scientist and learned how research discoveries are turned into real-world applications. It’s my honor to work with such a pawsome team.

This is an example post with audios. It supports local audio files.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include audio.html path="assets/audio/epicaly-short-113909.mp3" controls=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include audio.html path="https://cdn.pixabay.com/download/audio/2022/06/25/audio_69a61cd6d6.mp3" controls=true %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    A simple, elegant caption looks good between video rows, after each row, or doesn't have to be there at all.
</div>

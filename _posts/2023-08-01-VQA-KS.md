This blogpost will highlight the main ideas, concepts and findings presented in the Bachelor thesis on [Visual Question Answering (VQA) with Knowledge-based Semantics](https://findit.dtu.dk/en/catalog/62c6c822d4fccf03d747b3db) that considers training a VQA model with strong semantic and conceptual understanding by learning towards a latent space spanned by the Conceptnet Numberbatch embeddings on the [OK-VQA dataset](https://okvqa.allenai.org/). The blog post will revisit the model formulation, yet keep an emphasis on the proposed idea of presenting VQA models with strong semantic and conceptual understanding rather than solely focusing on accuracy as the performance metric. In the process, explainability tools are exploited.

    <article class="article-container">
        
        <p>According to the Old Testament, humanity, then speaking a single common language, decided to build a tower so tall it would reach God himself. In response to their arrogant intention, He confused their languages, creating a multitude of different dialects, with the result that they could no longer understand one another and the project was left unfinished. And yet, unbeknownst to them, there was still a universal, mysterious language that could have restored their coveted ability to communicate. A language that first developed independently in different times and places, without the slightest contact between them: from Babylon in 3000 B.C. and Egypt in 2500 B.C., to China in 1200 B.C. and Mesoamerica in 500 B.C. A language that, although based like all others on symbols and definitions, has the unique property of allowing us to describe nature with chilling detail. It is precisely this paradox that confronts us with one of humanity's greatest questions: is mathematics the pre-existing "language of the universe" that we are called to discover—the code with which we could potentially converse with extraterrestrial civilizations—or is it nothing more than an elaborate invention of the human brain—an illusion tailored to the data we receive from our senses—created to describe physical reality?</p>
        
        <p>In searching for an answer to this eternal question, you must be prepared to challenge your most fundamental beliefs, at times even your own logic, to survive the impending "mental" shock. For those of you who consider your worldview to be fixed and infallible, no one is stopping you from turning on the television; who knows, you might get lucky and catch the premiere of Survivor. For the rest of you who accept the challenge, it is never too late to take a seat at the school desk one more time...</p>
        
        <p>In middle school, a student first encounters the definition of a square root. From a 7th-grade textbook, I quote:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"The square root of a positive number α is the positive number which, when multiplied by itself, gives the number α. The square root of α is denoted by √α."</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The definition is clear: we just need to multiply any positive number by itself, and the result will be the number whose root is the original number. But have you ever wondered why the definition forces us to choose a positive number?</p>
        
        <p>Let's try to find the square root of -25. What we are looking for is a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives us -25. Let's call this number 'x'. So, we are looking for an x such that x × x = -25. If we take any positive number and multiply it by itself, what result will we get? For example, 2 × 2 = 4 (positive). 10 × 10 = 100 (positive). A positive number squared always yields a positive result. Therefore, it cannot give us -25. Now let's try with a negative number. What happens if we multiply -5 by itself? (-5) × (-5) = +25. Remember? A "minus" times a "minus" makes a "plus." The same goes for -2: (-2) × (-2) = +4. A negative number squared always yields a positive result. Therefore, a negative number cannot give us -25 either. And so, we "logically" conclude that the root of a negative number is not defined.</p>
        
        <p>But what if I told you that you wouldn't be able to read these words right now without the illogical—bordering on insane—square root of -25 (I'm not kidding, in mathematics it's called an imaginary number)? That without it, you wouldn't have Wi-Fi, radio, television, MRI scanners, and certainly, in the future, powerful quantum supercomputers and superintelligence? What if I told you that what seems impossible to conceive is, in reality, nothing more than a convention we mathematicians agree upon? A convention that, however, turns out to describe the laws of physics so well, it's as if it were already out there—or in the depths of our minds—formulated, ready to be revealed and to change our reality forever!</p>
        
        <hr>

        <p>As mischievous little mathematicians, let's now conduct an interesting thought experiment. Earlier, I mentioned the basic mathematical rule: "minus" times "minus" makes "plus" [(-) × (-) = (+)]. Have you ever wondered what would happen if we "cheated" a bit and changed the rules of the game, defining that:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>"minus" times "minus" makes "minus" [(-) × (-) = (-)],</li>
                <li>"plus" times "plus" makes "minus" [(+) × (+) = (-)],</li>
                <li>and, conversely, "minus" times "plus" makes "plus" [(-) × (+) = (+)]?</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>I know it seems strange at first glance. But if you think about it, we are only experimenting with different symbols, made of simple vertical and horizontal lines, whose essential nature we are not changing, only the order of their combination. Of course, you might object that the meaning implied is not so trivial, because the horizontal line (-) is associated in your mind with negative numbers, while the cross (+) is associated with their opposites, the positive numbers. You have correctly identified the fundamental distinction made in mathematics: the difference between the symbol (e.g., "-") and the concept it symbolizes (e.g., negative numbers).</p>
        
        <p>The exact same distinction exists between the symbol "1" and the concept of the "unit," which is mathematically defined as the neutral element of multiplication. It is, in other words, the number that, when multiplied by any random number, results in that same random number (i.e., 1 × X = X). But if we get a little "cunning" and apply our new rule, this property of the unit ceases to hold. If we take the number 2, for example, the multiplication 1 × 2 would result in -2, not 2, since our new rule states that (+) × (+) = (-). Thus, paradoxically, we have found a random number 'x' (the number 2) that, when multiplied by the unit, does not yield itself 'x' (but -2). This causes a significant contradiction, making the new system of rules we defined inconsistent, as a mathematician would say. This fact causes nightmares even for the most brilliant mathematicians and clashes with the logical coherence of the system. If you, however, do not fall into traps and are as intelligent as you believe (let me remind you that you have already avoided Survivor), I challenge you to find the violation of the most basic mathematical rule—for a hint, you were first taught it in the 2nd grade—that makes the system inconsistent and leads to the contradictory "proof" of the proposition "0=1" at the end of the article.</p>
        
        <hr>

        <p>The entire mathematical way of thinking has as its fundamental purpose the guarantee of consistency within the system where we apply mathematical methods. And as complex as mathematics may seem, the process it follows is, in its essence, remarkably simple and structured:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>We choose some fundamental, generally accepted truths—the axioms—that serve as the foundations of our mathematical edifice. For example, it is an axiom that "a unique straight line passes through two distinct points" or that "a circle can be drawn with a given center and radius."</li>
            <li>We choose a set of rules—operations, logical techniques, etc.—that allow us to prove new propositions—theorems, lemmas, corollaries—starting exclusively from the axioms and following logical steps.</li>
            <li>We avoid any contradiction at all costs. This means that every new proposition we formulate can be either only true or only false within the system we have defined, but never both simultaneously. If a proposition is true—that is, it agrees with the axioms, rules, and already proven propositions—we incorporate it into the system. Otherwise, we reject it.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Remember the previous example. As soon as we changed the rule of signs, we were led to the contradiction that "1"—which we had initially defined as the unit (an axiom)—no longer behaved as such. It no longer satisfied the property 1 × X = X for every random number X, since under the new rules we had 1 × 2 = -2. This contradiction—the disagreement of a new proposition with a fundamental axiom—rendered our new system inconsistent, forcing us to discard it.</p>
        
        <p>And while for millennia this model of thought seemed to be the most objective and integral thing the human mind had managed to conceive, in 1931 the then-unknown mathematician Kurt Gödel proved two earth-shattering propositions that forever changed our understanding of the limits of knowledge.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>I. First Incompleteness Theorem:</strong> In any axiomatic system (that is, one built from axioms) that is consistent (does not lead to contradictions) and powerful enough to describe basic arithmetic (addition, multiplication, etc.), there will always be propositions that, while true, are impossible to prove within the system itself. In other words, every such system is by definition incomplete.</p>
            <p><strong>II. Second Incompleteness Theorem:</strong> No such consistent and powerful axiomatic system can prove its own consistency.</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The proof of these theorems is a fascinating intellectual construction, which, due to its complexity, cannot be detailed here. However, to grasp the basic idea, we can draw the following parallel:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>The Card Paradox</strong></p>
            <p>Imagine a card with two sides:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>On one side, it says: "The statement on the other side of this card is true."</li>
                <li>On the other side, it says: "The statement on the other side of this card is false."</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>If we try to determine the truth of these statements, we get trapped in an endless logical loop: If we assume the first statement is true, then we must accept that the second is also true. But the second statement says the first is false. This contradicts our initial assumption. If, on the other hand, we assume the first statement is false, then the second must be false, which in turn means the first is true. Again, we end up in a contradiction. This is a classic self-reference paradox, similar to the famous phrase: "This statement is false."</p>
        
        <p>Gödel did something similar, but with absolute mathematical precision:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>He constructed, within the system of arithmetic, a mathematical proposition (let's call it G) that essentially encoded the following idea: "This proposition G is not provable within the system."</li>
            <li>From this, a dilemma arises:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the system managed to prove proposition G, it would be proving something that the proposition itself claims is unprovable. This would mean the system contains a contradiction, and is therefore inconsistent.</li>
                    <li>If the system cannot prove G, then what G claims is true (i.e., it is indeed unprovable). Therefore, we have a proposition that is true but unprovable.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>I know you might be getting confused (I warned you this would be a brain-burner, but you insist on reading willingly despite Survivor), but it is worth rereading it as many times as necessary to grasp the immense significance of this conclusion: in mathematics, there are certain truths that we know are valid, yet they cannot be proven with the tools of the system we have chosen.</p>
        
        <hr>

        <p>In other words, there is no "absolute" mathematical truth. Truth is relative and depends on the axioms—the initial truths—that make up our chosen system. We can, for instance, construct two different mathematical systems where a specific proposition is true in one and the exact same proposition is false in the other. And the most impressive part? Neither system is wrong! Both are absolutely correct, each in its own way!</p>
        
        <p>One of the most characteristic examples of this idea is the story of Euclid's Fifth Postulate, also known as the Parallel Postulate. This axiom states that "through a point not on a given line, there is one and only one line parallel to the given line." For over two millennia, mathematicians considered this axiom a self-evident truth of our world. Its acceptance, along with the other four axioms, gives rise to Euclidean Geometry: the familiar, flat space we learn about in school, where the sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees and parallel lines never meet. This is the geometry we use to build our houses, design our furniture, and understand our immediate, local space.</p>
        
        <p>In the 19th century, however, mathematicians dared to do the unthinkable: they challenged the Parallel Postulate. What would happen if we changed it? What if we assume that "through a point not on a given line, no line parallel to it can be drawn"? The answer is simple: Spherical Geometry emerges, the geometry that holds on the surface of a sphere, like the Earth. Here, "straight lines" are great circles (like meridians), and the sum of the angles of a triangle is always greater than 180 degrees (I challenge you to find the nearest globe and draw a triangle on it yourself to see). Correspondingly, if we assume that "infinitely many parallel lines can be drawn," we get Hyperbolic Geometry (this is the geometry that corresponds, schematically, to a saddle). The most amazing thing is that these geometries are not "wrong." They are perfectly consistent mathematical systems with enormous practical applications. Spherical Geometry is the foundation of modern navigation, aviation, cartography, and astronomy, as it allows for the precise calculation of the shortest path on the curved surface of the Earth or other spherical bodies. The choice of the "correct" system, therefore, is not a matter of absolute truth, but a matter of the problem we are called to solve.</p>
        
        <figure class="article-image">
            <img src="/images/geometry.png" alt="Diagram comparing Spherical and Hyperbolic Geometry.">
            <figcaption>A visual representation of Spherical Geometry (left) and Hyperbolic Geometry (right). Unlike flat Euclidean geometry, the properties of shapes change dramatically here: on a sphere, "parallel" lines eventually intersect and the sum of a triangle's angles exceeds 180°, while on a hyperbolic surface, "parallel" lines diverge and the sum is less than 180°.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Let's return to our original problem: the square root of -25. Within the system of real numbers—the set of all numbers that can be placed on a straight line (positive, negative, integers, fractions)—we previously showed that the equation x² = -25 has no solution. For centuries, mathematicians simply accepted this fact. The revolution came when mathematicians like Euler and Gauss decided not to see this impasse as a limitation, but as an invitation to create a new, broader system. What did they do? They introduced a new rule, a new "axiom," defying the old one. They defined a new entity, which they called the imaginary unit (i), with one unique property: i² = -1. Thus, for the equation x² = -25, we have x = 5i (you can easily verify this by doing the math yourself). They did not try to explain it in terms of the old system. They simply defined it and built a new, consistent system around it: the complex numbers (numbers of the form a + bi, which have a real and an imaginary part). This system was not "wrong"; it was just different, capable of solving problems the previous one could not even touch, with the marvelous practical applications I mentioned at the beginning.</p>
        
        <hr>

        <p>Quite reasonably, you might think that Gödel proved the "mortality" of mathematics—its inherent inability to give us absolute, objective answers, independent of the system we choose. And yet, it is precisely at this point that the deeper beauty and grandeur of not only mathematics but all of scientific knowledge is revealed. Mathematics, through its own logic, does not deny its foundations. On the contrary, it is as if it tells us with absolute intellectual honesty:</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"Even if I accept as true the entire axiomatic system I use, I can prove to you, with my own tools, that there will always be truths I cannot prove."</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This admission does not tear down the mathematical edifice. Instead, it makes it fully aware of its nature and its limits. Such a system: does not self-destruct, but proves its integrity by recognizing and accepting its limits; does not pretend to be complete and "all-knowing," but places consistency as its highest value; humbly accepts that some questions are beyond its capabilities; adapts with amazing flexibility, allowing the creation of different "worlds" to describe different aspects of reality (remember the example of spherical geometry or imaginary numbers); and grants the mathematician the freedom, imagination, and creativity to define the initial conditions himself and explore the universes they generate.</p>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>"If we define religion as a system of thought that contains unprovable propositions—that is, it contains an element of faith—then Gödel taught us that not only is mathematics a religion, but it is the only religion that can logically prove it is a religion."</p>
            <footer>— John D. Barrow</footer>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>This formidable realization comes from the fact that mathematics reveals—itself, with logical coherence—its own unavoidable, unprovable core, something no other ideology or religion can do without self-contradiction. Just as in mathematics we start from axioms, so too does every ideology (e.g., political, philosophical, religious) start from basic principles, such as "all men are created equal," "freedom is the supreme value," "God is omnipotent," etc. These principles are not proven within the system but are accepted from the outset.</p>
        
        <p>For example, many traditional theological arguments—such as the ontological (e.g., God is the most perfect being we can conceive, and proof of his perfection is his existence; a perfect being would not be perfect if it did not exist), the teleological (e.g., the human eye is so complex it could not have arisen by chance, therefore someone designed it), or the fine-tuning argument (e.g., if the gravitational constant were slightly different, there would be no stars or life, so someone "tuned" the universe)—attempt to logically prove the existence of God. But if a religion tries to logically prove that God exists (without relying solely on faith), then: if the proof fails, the dogma is jeopardized; if it proves that it cannot prove this dogma, then it acknowledges the need for faith, meaning it cannot be logically complete. In any case, by trying to "rationalize" its own faith, it violates its own foundation: that faith operates independently of logic. Only mathematics, however, has managed to logically prove the necessity of an element of "faith"—that is, of true but unprovable propositions.</p>
        
        <hr>

        <p>Reaching the end of this mental journey (I know, you're about to say "you've tired us out," but I hope it made you think, even a little), we return to the initial, fundamental question posed after the story of the Tower of Babel: is mathematics, this mysterious universal language, a discovery or an invention? The search for the answer, which is anything but simple, should not be an end in itself, as the truth lies on a fine, almost invisible line between the two.</p>
        
        <p>On the one hand, if mathematics is a discovery, if its structures pre-exist in the fabric of the universe, then Gödel's theorems acquire a profound cosmic significance. They tell us that the universe itself, in its fundamental logic, contains limits. That absolute, complete knowledge is unattainable, not due to human weakness, but because "incompleteness" is embedded in its very code. From this perspective, the universe whispers to us that everything has a limit, even what we considered our most perfect and absolute creation: logic. Almost poetically, it is as if it tells us that even death—the ultimate incompleteness—comes to realize "achievable" completeness—fulfillment—through imperfection.</p>
        
        <p>On the other hand, if mathematics is an invention, then we witness the limitless power, but also the inherent limits, of the human brain. We are not discovering objective reality, but inventing countless, different, subjective versions of it, each consistent and powerful within its own framework. Euclidean, Spherical, and Hyperbolic Geometry are not three facets of the same truth, but three different, parallel worlds born from our imagination by choosing different initial conditions, different axioms (perhaps the hypothesis of parallel universes mathematically "translates" to the choice of systems based on different axioms?). This gives us the incredible freedom to build the tools we need, not to find "The Truth," but to solve the problems posed by the reality we experience.</p>
        
        <p>And if you ask me which true but unprovable proposition I choose to believe in, then my faith is this: without always having logical evidence to prove it, I believe that mathematics will continue to grant us descriptions and predictions of reality that are as diverse as they are chillingly accurate. Besides, if I did not believe this as a mathematician and theoretical physicist, I would have to accept my impending professional demise and my eternal financial poverty.</p>
        
        <p>"The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible," said Einstein. It shouldn't have to be; nothing obliges it to be. And yet, it is precisely there that the value of mathematics and science in general emerges with certainty—whether as a discovery or an invention. The quest for truth and knowledge—the journey and not the destination—is a deep existential need for humanity. Remember the civilizations that, though isolated in space and time, developed mathematics as if they could not live without it. So, every time you turn on the television to watch a science fiction movie, stop for a moment to realize that you are already the protagonists in the most successful and true (but is it provable?) sci-fi of all time. The movie that—as proven by Gödel—is simultaneously both Science and Fiction, demanding both logical rigor and the free, creative discovery of mystery, a mystery that invites us to decode it, knowing in advance that every answer we find will simply give birth to a deeper and more beautiful question...</p>

        <h3>The "Proof" of "1 = 0"</h3>
        <div class="proof-section">
            <ol>
                <li>Let a and b be two random numbers such that a = b.</li>
                <li>a² = ab</li>
                <li>2a² = a² + ab</li>
                <li>2a² - 2ab = a² - ab</li>
                <li>2(a² - ab) = 1(a² - ab)</li>
                <li>2 = 1</li>
                <li>1 = 0</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Where is the contradiction (if, in your opinion, one always exists) that makes the system inconsistent?</p>

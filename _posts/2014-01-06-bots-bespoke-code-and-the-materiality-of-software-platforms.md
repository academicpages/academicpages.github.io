This is a new article published in _Information, Communication, and Society_ as part of their annual special issue for the Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR) conference. This year&#8217;s special issue was edited by Lee Humphreys and Tarleton Gillespie, who did a great job throughout the whole process.

Abstract: This article introduces and discusses the role of _bespoke code_ in Wikipedia, which is code that runs alongside a platform or system, rather than being integrated into server-side codebases by individuals with privileged access to the server. Bespoke code complicates the common metaphors of platforms and sovereignty that we typically use to discuss the governance and regulation of software systems through code. Specifically, the work of automated software agents (bots) in the operation and administration of Wikipedia is examined, with a focus on the materiality of code. As bots extend and modify the functionality of sites like Wikipedia, but must be continuously operated on computers that are independent from the servers hosting the site, they involve alternative relations of power and code. Instead of taking for granted the pre-existing stability of Wikipedia as a platform, bots and other bespoke code require that we examine not only the software code itself, but also the concrete, historically contingent material conditions under which this code is run. To this end, this article weaves a series of autobiographical vignettes about the author&#8217;s experiences as a bot developer alongside more traditional academic discourse.

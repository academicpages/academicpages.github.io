Anika Kapur
===========
Undergraduate Researcher, Spring 2022
-------------------------------------

Anika Kapur is currently a freshman at Emory University interested in majoring in International Studies and Biology. Originally from Cleveland, Ohio, she lived in Brazil for about six years throughout high school. Thereafter, Anika spent a gap year serving with AmeriCorps NCCC, conducting volunteer projects related to disaster relief, food insecurity, affordable housing, sustainability, and Covid-19 vaccine distribution in five different states. Outside of Anika's interest in global human rights, I enjoy writing poetry, thinking about different scientific quandaries, and running.

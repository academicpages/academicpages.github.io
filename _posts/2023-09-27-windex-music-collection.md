### Appendix

Someone made a [similar collection](https://rateyourmusic.com/list/code_gs/songs-that-use-the-bed-squeaking-sound/) of songs that sample a bed squeaking sound.

Found these amazing songs by Lil Windex while looking for some additional songs: [Cleanin Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMA_iZ7effY), [Bitcoin Ca$h](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAMRFDs9iOs).

A random crazy [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vbR2X3sJNs) by Ugly God that samples the iPhone ringtone.

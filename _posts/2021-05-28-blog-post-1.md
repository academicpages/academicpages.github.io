Today, I gave a short talk at this year’s Virtual Spring CNLM Conference with the topic “[Memory: It’s About Time]( https://cnlm.uci.edu/2021-spring-conference/)”. My talk took place in one of the data blitz sessions entitled “Memory Matters: Studies Examining Human Memory”. It was great to learn about the cutting-edge research from neuroscientists across the U.S. with a focus on learning and memory.

This time, the oral presentation was limited to 4 minutes, 1 slide, and only 1 key take-away. This requirement pushed me to really think deeply about what I want to tell my audience about my research. I also gained a good experience of effectively communicating complicated research and data analyses in a single slide.

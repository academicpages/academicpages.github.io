Hi! Damian here. Welcome to my new website. I built it on GitHub using the [`Minimal Mistakes`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) template for Jekyll. Read this article to learn more.

I confess that I was trying to use (and even forked) the [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template, which is based on [`Minimal Mistakes`](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). Still, I was seduced by the original, plus I believe that the Academic Pages template is not being maintained at the moment of writing.

For a full (but concise) walkthrough about how I built my website using Jekyll, GitHub, and Minimal Mistakes on MacOs Catalina, please read the following article:

['How I built this website'](link)

Please feel free to navigate and do contact me if you have any questions about my current projects or if you would like to collaborate on something related. And remember to... 

Jump higher!

\- Damian

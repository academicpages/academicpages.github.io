The Beginning
======

So good they can't ignore you
------

Great things have passed through september. I did start my graduate studies at Penn. I encountered dozens of people across CIS, grad community, Penn Blockchain, Korean Grad community, Wharton people, etc. 

Craftsmanship
------
Rather than looking out for some wonders or things the company will give you, you should orient yourself towards more "what can I offer the world" mindset. This requires repetitive hard work to achieve the level at which your expertise and knowledge carries a substantial market value.


Goals of 2022
------
- Get internship offers from 2 of FAANG
  - LeetCode 200 in Python and C++
- Get internship offers from 2 of top-tier Quant Trading Firms(TS, JS, HRT, Citadel, Arrowstreet, DEShaw, Five Rings)
  - Create and test Backtesting strategies, Master the Macro Market View
- 1st in CIS519, 5th in CIS556, A in CIS545

If any of the above fails, your three months and money spent would just be in vain. Think about how you planned and achieved your goals back in 2015 Fall. Think about how desperate you were to prove yourself. How angry you were at the world for not letting you in. When you faced your reality and the next steps necessary to amend them one by one.

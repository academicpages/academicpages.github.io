I [spoke](https://2024-na.nixcon.org/talks/#the-case-for-nix-on-the-home-server) at [NixCon North America](https://2024-na.nixcon.org/) this year. The event was co-located with [SCaLE 21x](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/21x) (March 14-17, 2024 in Pasadena, California). This is a talk for **beginners** to Nix. You will learn the highlights of what Nix offers and see how Nix helps to set up a home server.

> Why is Nix a good choice for a home server? Learn how Nix enables maintenance free, secure, and reproducible home servers. The talk will cover why Nix is a powerful choice compared to other technologies like Docker or Ansible. It will also showcase how Nix makes it easy to get up and running with server applications such as Nginx, Wireguard, Jellyfin, Samba, and more.

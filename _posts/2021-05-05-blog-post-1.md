I am glad to receive this year's [Roger W. Russell Scholar's Award](https://cnlm.uci.edu/awards/russell-award/) from UCI CNLM. With this award, I receive $1000 to support research-related activities, and will be honored and give a research elevator pitch at the upcoming virtual CNLM Awards Ceremony on May 18th.

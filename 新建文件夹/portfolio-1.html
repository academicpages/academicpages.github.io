title: "Stochastic plasticity"
excerpt: "We develop a finite element framework for the solution of stochastic
elastoplastic boundary value problems with non-Gaussian parametric uncertainty. The framework relies upon a stochastic Galerkin formulation, where
the stiffness random field is decomposed using a multidimensional polynomial chaos expansion. At the constitutive level, a Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov
(FPK) plasticity framework is utilized, under the assumption of small strain kinematics. A linearization procedure is developed that serves to update
the polynomial chaos coefficients of the expanded random stiffness in the elastoplastic regime, leading to a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem. 
The proposed framework is illustrated in a static shear beam example of elastic-perfectly plastic as well as isotropic hardening material"

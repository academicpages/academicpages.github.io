I currently manage a small (but powerful) team of imaging experts at [The Jackson Laboratory](https://jax.org), a biomedical research nonprofit. We work on institution-wide imaging support: think more "how do we get tool X to work in our environment" or "how do we teach people the best way to apply deep learning methods to their images", less "we will develop a custom tool for your specific research project". Our team is 100% focused on supporting open-source tools.

## What does that mean in practice?

A lot of my time is dedicated to [OMERO](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/), the imaging data management platform we use. Our team is responsible for keeping it running, drive adoption and make it easier for folks to use it. A (different) lot of my time is dedicated to [training](https://github.com/erickmartins/training) people on how to use open-source image analysis/data management tools. There is also a lot of talking to faculty and researchers about what they need, and how we can support them.

## Here are some projects I have been working on:

- [ezomero](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/ezomero) is a convenience-layer library to interact with OMERO servers using Python. I am currently the main developer and maintainer.
- [omero-cli-transfer](https://github.com/ome/omero-cli-transfer) is a utility tool for transfering data between OMERO servers, preserving hierarchies, annotations and regions of interest. I am also the main developer and maintainer.

## What else do I do?

-   I spend a lot of time on [forum.image.sc]() answering people's questions and learning from other people's answers.
- I'm part of the Curriculum Advisory Committee for the [Image Processing curriculum at The Carpentries](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/) and of the BINA [Image Informatics Working Group](https://www.bioimagingnorthamerica.org/image-informatics-wg/).
- I co-organize the [Northeast (US?) Bioimage Analysis Meeting](https://www.jax.org/education-and-learning/education-calendar/2024/11-november/northeast-bioimage-analysis-meeting) at The Jackson Laboratory.

# Welcome to my website!

Hi, thanks for stopping by.

I am a machine learning research at [Arena AI](https://arena-ai.com) where we are working on generative models of customer behavior to help build autonomous, self-learning systems at large enterprise companies. Previously, I have worked on economic models of competition and network growth as a research scientist at Facebook, on advertising, pricing, and marketplace growth as a senior machine learning engineer at Instacart (L6), and on causal inference and advertiser behavior at Microsoft Research.

I earned a PhD in Economics at Stanford Graduate School of Business, advised by [Susan Athey](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/susan-athey), [Guido Imbens](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/guido-w-imbens), and [Wesley Hartmann](https://web.stanford.edu/~wesleyr/index.html). My research focused on developing new methods for causal inference and machine learning, with applications to marketing and economics. In my spare time, I teach an online class on Applied Causal Inference, focused on applications of ML and causal inference in the tech industry.

I live in Brooklyn, where I enjoy cooking, swing dancing, and playing with my dog, [Peanut](https://www.instagram.com/peanut_the_pommie).

Course Description
======

The lecture is intended for students of mathematics, computer science, applied computer science and IT security.
It provides an introduction to the theory of grammars (especially context-free grammars) and automata (finite state automaton, pushdown automaton, Turing machine).
It will also give an insight into computability and NP-comleteness theory, where the question is which computational problems can be solved (at all or with reasonable effort).
It will be shown that there are inherently hard problems that cannot be solved satisfactorily by computers.
The lecture will yiels fundamental insights into the relationship between automata and grammars and the relationship between determinism and non-determinism.
By practicing techniques such as mutual simulation or (polynomially) computable reductions, the insight should mature that concepts that look different on the surface can be identical at the core.
The goal is also deeper understanding of complexity.
On the lower levels of the so-called Chomsky hierarchy one finds efficiently solvable application problems of text manipulation and text analysis.
On the upper levels, on the other hand, one encounters the phenomenon of the inherent hardness (or even undecidability) of a problem.

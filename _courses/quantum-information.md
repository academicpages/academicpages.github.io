Course Description
======

This course will give an introduction to quantum information and quantum computation from the perspective of theoretical computer science.
We will discuss the mathematical model of quantum bits and circuits, how to generalize computer science concepts to the quantum setting, how to design and analyze quantum algorithms and protocols for a variety of computational problems, and how to prove complexity theoretic lower bounds.

Topics to be covered will likely included:

* Fundamental axioms of quantum mechanics: from classical to quantum bits
* Few-qubit protocols: teleportation and no-cloning
* The power of entanglement: Bell inequalities and CHSH game
* Quantum circuit model of computation
* Basic quantum algorithms: Deutsch-Josza, Bernstein-Vazirani, Simon
* Grover's search algorithm and beyond
* Quantum Fourier transform and phase estimation
* Shor's factoring algorithm
* Quantum query lower bounds
* Quantum complexity theory
* Quantum probabilities: mixed stated, POVM measurements, quantum channels
* Quantum entropy and Holevo bound
* Quantum error correction
* Quantum cryptography
* Quantum "Supremacy"

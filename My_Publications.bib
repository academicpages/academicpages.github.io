  abstract = {The design of molecular architectures exhibiting functional motions is a promising area for disruptive technological development. Toward this goal, rotaxanes and catenanes, which undergo relative motions of their subunits in response to external stimuli, are prime candidates. Here, we report on the computational analysis of the contraction/extension of a bistable [c2]daisy chain rotaxane. Using free-energy calculations and transition path optimizations, we explore the free-energy landscape governing the functional motions of a prototypical molecular machine with atomic resolution. The calculations reveal a sequential mechanism in which the asynchronous gliding of each ring is preferred over the concerted movement. Analysis of the underlying free-energy surface indicates that the formation of partially rearranged intermediates entails crossing of much smaller barriers. Our findings illustrate an important design principle for molecular machines, namely that efficient exploitation of thermal fluctuations may be realized by breaking down the large-scale functional motions into smaller steps.},

  abstract = {Proton-powered c-ring rotation in mitochondrial ATP synthase is crucial to convert the transmembrane protonmotive force into torque to drive the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Capitalizing on recent cryo-EM structures, we aim at a structural and energetic understanding of how functional directional rotation is achieved. We performed multi-microsecond atomistic simulations to determine the free energy profiles along the c-ring rotation angle before and after the arrival of a new proton. Our results reveal that rotation proceeds by dynamic sliding of the ring over the a-subunit surface, during which interactions with conserved polar residues stabilize distinct intermediates. Ordered water chains line up for a Grotthuss-type proton transfer in one of these intermediates. After proton transfer, a high barrier prevents backward rotation and an overall drop in free energy favors forward rotation, ensuring the directionality of c-ring rotation required for the thermodynamically disfavored ATP synthesis. The essential arginine of the a-subunit stabilizes the rotated configuration through a salt bridge with the c-ring. Overall, we describe a complete mechanism for the rotation step of the ATP synthase rotor, thereby illuminating a process critical to all life at atomic resolution.},

  abstract = {Myosin motors use the energy of ATP to produce force and directed movement on actin by a swing of the lever arm. ATP is hydrolysed during the off-actin re-priming transition termed recovery stroke. To provide an understanding of chemo-mechanical transduction by myosin, it is critical to determine how the reverse swing of the lever arm and ATP hydrolysis are coupled. Previous studies concluded that the recovery stroke of myosin II is initiated by closure of the Switch II loop in the nucleotide-binding site. Recently, we proposed that the recovery stroke of myosin VI starts with the spontaneous re-priming of the converter domain to a putative pre-transition state (PTS) intermediate that precedes Switch II closing and ATPase activation. Here, we investigate the transition from the pre-recovery, post-rigor (PR) state to PTS in myosin VI using geometric free energy simulations and the string method. First, our calculations rediscover the PTS state agnostically and show that it is accessible from PR via a low free energy transition path. Second, separate path calculations using the string method illuminate the mechanism of the PR to PTS transition with atomic resolution. In this mechanism, the initiating event is a large movement of the converter/lever-arm region that triggers rearrangements in the Relay-SH1 region and the formation of the kink in the Relay helix with no coupling to the active site. Analysis of the free-energy barriers along the path suggests that the converter-initiated mechanism is much faster that the one initiated by Switch II closure, which supports the biological relevance of PTS as a major on-pathway intermediate of the recovery stroke in myosin VI. Our analysis suggests that lever-arm re-priming and ATP hydrolysis are only weakly coupled, so that the myosin recovery stroke is mostly driven by thermal fluctuations and stabilised by nucleotide consumption via a ratchet-like mechanism.},

  abstract = {The release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from actin filaments constitutes a key step in their regulated turnover, which is fundamental to many cellular functions. The mechanisms underlying Pi release from the core and barbed end of actin filaments remain unclear. Here, using human and bovine actin isoforms, we combine cryo-EM with molecular-dynamics simulations and in vitro reconstitution to demonstrate how actin releases Pi through a `molecular backdoor'. While constantly open at the barbed end, the backdoor is predominantly closed in filament-core subunits and opens only transiently through concerted amino acid rearrangements. This explains why Pi escapes rapidly from the filament end but slowly from internal subunits. In a nemaline-myopathy-associated actin variant, the backdoor is predominantly open in filament-core subunits, resulting in accelerated Pi release and filaments with drastically shortened ADP-Pi caps. Our results provide the molecular basis for Pi release from actin and exemplify how a disease-linked mutation distorts the nucleotide-state distribution and atomic structure of the filament.},

  abstract = {The primary immunological target of COVID-19 vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. S is exposed on the viral surface and mediates viral entry into the host cell. To identify possible antibody binding sites, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of a 4.1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length, fully glycosylated and palmitoylated S proteins. By mapping steric accessibility, structural rigidity, sequence conservation, and generic antibody binding signatures, we recover known epitopes on S and reveal promising epitope candidates for structure-based vaccine design. We find that the extensive and inherently flexible glycan coat shields a surface area larger than expected from static structures, highlighting the importance of structural dynamics. The protective glycan shield and the high flexibility of its hinges give the stalk overall low epitope scores. Our computational epitope-mapping procedure is general and should thus prove useful for other viral envelope proteins whose structures have been characterized.},

Here, we combine cryo electron tomography, subtomogram averaging and molecular dynamics simulations to structurally analyze S in situ. Compared to recombinant S, the viral S was more heavily glycosylated and occurred mostly in the closed pre-fusion conformation. We show that the stalk domain of S contains three hinges, giving the head unexpected orientational freedom. We propose that the hinges allow S to scan the host cell surface, shielded from antibodies by an extensive glycan coat. The structure of native S contributes to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of safe vaccines.},

  abstract = {The steady emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants gives us a real-time view of the interplay between viral evolution and the host immune defense. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target of antibodies. Here, we show that steric accessibility to antibodies provides a strong predictor of mutation activity in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron. We introduce an antibody accessibility score (AAS) that accounts for the steric shielding effect of glycans at the surface of spike. We find that high values of the AAS correlate strongly with the sites of mutations in the spike proteins of newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. We use the AAS to assess the escapability of variant spike proteins, i.e., their ability to escape antibody-based immune responses. The high calculated escapability of the Omicron variant BA.5 with respect to both wild-type (WT) vaccination and BA.1 infection is consistent with its rapid spread despite high rates of vaccination and prior infection with earlier variants. We calculated the AAS from structural and molecular dynamics simulation data that were available early in the pandemic, in the spring of 2020. The AAS thus allows us to prospectively assess the ability of variant spike proteins to escape antibody-based immune responses and to pinpoint regions of expected mutation activity in future variants.},

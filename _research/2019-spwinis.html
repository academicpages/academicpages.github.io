<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Results of image stitching can be perceptually divided into single-perspective and multiple-perspective. Compared to the multiple-perspective result, the single-perspective result excels in perspective consistency but suffers from projective distortion. In this paper, we propose two single-perspective warps for natural image stitching. The first one is a parametric warp, which is an incremental combination of the dual-feature-based as-projective-as-possible warp and the quasi-homography warp. The second one is a mesh-based warp, which is determined by optimizing a total energy function that simultaneously emphasizes different characteristics of the single-perspective warp, including alignment, distortion and saliency. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that the proposed warp outperforms some stateof-the-art warps in urban scenes, including APAP, AutoStitch, SPHP and GSP.</p>

<h2>Datasets</h2>

<p>We experimented with our algorithm on images from public datasets, include DH [5], CAVE [6], SPHP [3], AANAP [4], GSP [2] and APAP [1]. We also tested our method on our own <a href='https://tlliao.github.io/images/dataset-2.zip'>dataset</a>, you can download here.

title: "How is population decline influenced by evolutionary mechanisms?"
excerpt: " The Flanagan Lab utilizes population genetics tools to improve our understanding of the genetic dynamics and factors that contribute to declining populations. The field of conservation genetics looks at the application of genetic/genomic data to inform and improve conservation efforts and the restoration of populations. Our lab is using a variety of molecular tools to investigate the evolutionary mechanisms impacting New Zealand populations of kororā, pipefish and vegetation impacted by dieback disease "

We are interested in studying what causes populations to decline. Variation between populations is driven by a number of evolutionary mechanisms, for example, the availability of prey species, introduction of disease, inbreeding depression and intraspecific phenotypic variation. Evaluating the ecological and evolutionary interactions within populations is important for informing effective conservation management of endemic species.

To conserve endemic species in Aotearoa, we can utilise the field of population genetics, investigating the structure of local populations and the factors that impact the genome across generations. When informing conservation management efforts, understanding and acknowledging different evolutionary mechanisms is important as they may be impacting population growth e.g. inbreeding depression. We can utilise population genetic/genomic tools to estimate effective population sizes and establish a baseline dataset on population structure, against which we can measure change over time. The Flanagan lab is exploring molecular methods for assessing Pohatu’s kororā population, with a focus on reducing the need for invasive sampling. We are particularly interested in breeding pairs where parents are a mix of the white-flippered and little blue morphotypes. We hope to utilise molecular methods to better understand the persistence of the white-flippered morphotype, which is unique to the Canterbury region and explore the impacts phylogenetic constraints may be having on the colony. Additionally, we are working on modelling the distribution of the wide-bodied pipefish, Stigmatopora nigra, and using genetic analysis to compare population structure across its range. By comparing phenotypic and genotypic data of S. nigra across Aotearoa we will evaluate different selection pressures, assess the evolutionary mechanisms that drive local populations and expand on the currently limited understanding of gene flow across the S. nigra range.

Understanding causations factors such as disease is important for conserving the species they affect. The flanagan lab is currently focused on diet and disease as agents of decline. In collaboration with Mana Whenua, Pohatu Penguins and the LaRue and ConSERT labs we are utilizing long-read nanopore sequencing to assess the diet of the Pohatu population of kororā as a potential driver of local population decline. Using non-invasive fecal and molt feather samples to develop a baseline understanding of local diet, this project aims to facilitate community engagement in genetic sampling of local populations. Collaboration with the Banks Peninsula community will be further supported through the development of remote sequencing using the portable MinION device (Oxford nanopore technologies). In addition to diet in kororā populations, the Flanagan lab is interested in the coevolution of invasive diseases, specifically Phytophthora, and the vegetation they impact. In collaboration with Claudia Meisrimler, we are looking at Phytophthora cinnamomi, which causes dieback non-discriminantly across endemic and economically important flora and is a close relative to P. agathidicida; the source of Kauri dieback. Improving our understanding of the P. cinnamoni genome and how it co-evolves with valuable vegetation will allow for better informed management and conservation programmes aimed at tackling dieback diseases.

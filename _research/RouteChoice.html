<!-- <h2 align="left">Summary</h2>

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>Fare evasion is a problem in many public transport systems around the world. A survey from the International Association of Public Transport (IAPT) found that fare evasion averaged 4.2% across their sample of (primarily) bus routes in 31 systems and 18 countries. Policies to reduce fare evasion are generally aimed at improving control systems and increasing ﬁnes for offenders. Likewise, many studies have focused on the design of punishment strategies to tackle fare evasion. However, this, rather simplistic view does not consider the different social and contextual aspects in which fare evasion takes place.</p>
​<p>The main objective of this presentation is to show that fare evasion levels are the product of a combination of several factors, including the level of income of the area where bus stops are located, period of the day, level of service (headways and overcrowding), bus door operation (entrance door and number of doors), the level of inspection, among others. To analyze and quantify the impact of each variable this study used an econometric approach. Our findings provides a powerful tool to predict the impact of some public policies to deal with evasion and also having a better understanding of this complex issue.</p>

<h1 align="center">Route choice experiment </h1>

The experiment was fully programmed in Python and the following four videos show the four experimental conditions. The experiment was conducted with 72 university students from London, UK (50%) and Santiago, Chile (50%), who were randomly assigned into these four experimental conditions.

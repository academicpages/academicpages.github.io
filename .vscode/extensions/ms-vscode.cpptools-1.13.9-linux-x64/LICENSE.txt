MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

MICROSOFT C/C++ EXTENSION FOR VISUAL STUDIO CODE
________________________________________
These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or
one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any
Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such services or
updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those
different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s
rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE
LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.  BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT
THESE TERMS.

1.      INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
a)      General. You may install and use any number of copies of the software
only with Microsoft Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio Code,
Azure DevOps, Team Foundation Server, and successor Microsoft products and
services to develop and test your applications. Further, you may install, use
and/or deploy these software copies via a network management system or as part
of a desktop image within your internal corporate network to develop and test
your applications.
b)      Third Party Components. The software may include third party components
with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be
described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.

2.      SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement
only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other
rights.  For clarification Microsoft, or its licensors, retains ownership of
all aspects of the software.   Unless applicable law gives you more rights
despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted
in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations
in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. For example, if
Microsoft technically limits or disables extensibility for the software, you
may not extend the software by, among other things, loading or injecting into
the software any non-Microsoft add-ins, macros, or packages; modifying the
software registry settings; or adding features or functionality equivalent to
that found in Microsoft products and services. You may not:
a)      work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow
you to use it in certain ways;
b)      reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise
attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent
required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source
components that may be included in the software;
c)      remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its
suppliers in the software;
d)      use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or
propagate malware; or
e)      share, publish, distribute, or lease the software (except for any
distributable code, subject to the terms above), provide the software as a
stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this
agreement to any third party.

3.      DATA.
a)      Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and
your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this
information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may
opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product
documentation.  There are also some features in the software that may enable
you to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features
to enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with applicable
law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications. You
can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and the
privacy statement at https://aka.ms/privacy. Your use of the software operates
as your consent to these practices.
b)      Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or
subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes
the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms
of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr.

4.      EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and
international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which
include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further
information on export restrictions, visit https://aka.ms/exporting.

5.      SUPPORT SERVICES. Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to
provide any support services for the software. Any support provided is “as
is”, “with all faults”, and without warranty of any kind.

6.      ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may
provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire
agreement for the software.

7.      APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the
software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province
where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is
located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach,
and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and
tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the
software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction
exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the
federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If
not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the
Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.

8.      CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain
legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the
laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with
Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you
acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the
laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you
acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law
applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
a)      Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer
Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
b)      Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving
updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device
from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the
software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the
software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off
updates for your specific device or software.
c)      Germany and Austria.
i.      Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as
described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However,
Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.
ii.     Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross
negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of
death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the
statutory law.
Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight
negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations,
the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the
breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance
with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations").
In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight
negligence.

9.      DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR
THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR
CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES
ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

10.     LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR
RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN
RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00.
YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS,
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or
condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in
each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.

Please note: As this software is distributed in Canada, some of the clauses in
this agreement are provided below in French.

Remarque: Ce logiciel étant distribué au Canada, certaines des clauses dans
ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.

EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel
quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril.
Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier
de droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des
consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par
le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande,
d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont
exclues.

LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES
DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une
indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US.
Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y
compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de
bénéfices.

Cette limitation concerne:
•       tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y
compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes
tiers; et
•       les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou
au titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans
la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.

Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait
connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas
l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects,
accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou
l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.

EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous
pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le
présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de
votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.

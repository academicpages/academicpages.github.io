## Issues? Questions? Feature requests?

**PLEASE**, if you experience any problems, have any questions, or have an idea
for a new feature, create an issue on [the GitHub page](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools)!

This extension itself *does not* provide language support for the CMake scripting language.
For that we bundle [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake) which provides the support.
A closed-source extension that provides even better support can also be installed: [CMake Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=josetr.cmake-language-support-vscode)

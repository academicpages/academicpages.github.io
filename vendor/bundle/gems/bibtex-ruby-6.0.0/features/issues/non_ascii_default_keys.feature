Feature: Parse BibTeX files and convert LaTeX to Unicode
	As a hacker who works with bibliographies
	I want to be able to have autogenerated keys respect non-ASCII characters
	by transliterating them

  @default_keys
	Scenario: A single entry with an author whose name contains non-ASCII characters
		When I create an entry with these elements:
			| type | author           | title | location | year |
			| book | Christian Müller | Title | Berlin   | 2013 |
		Then my bibliography should contain an entry with a key like "m(u|ue)?ller2013a"

  @default_keys
	Scenario: Multiple entries with an author whose name contains non-ASCII characters
		When I create entries with these elements:
			| type | author           | title        | location | year |
			| book | Christian Müller | First Title  | Berlin   | 2013 |
			| book | Christian Müller | Second Title | Berlin   | 2013 |
		Then my bibliography should contain an entry with a key like "m(ue?)?ller2013a"
		And my bibliography should contain an entry with a key like "m(ue?)?ller2013b"

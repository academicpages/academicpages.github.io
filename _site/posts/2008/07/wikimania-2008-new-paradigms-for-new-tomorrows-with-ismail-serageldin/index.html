<p>Director of the Library of Alexandria, Dr. Ismail Serageldin gave a keynote speech on the first day of Wikimania 2008 titled, New Paradigms for New Tomorrows.  It was quite thoughtful and inspiring – the man is one of the most amazing individuals I have heard.  He is learned in so many different areas of academic and cultural knowledge, as well as incredibly wise.  I would recommend watching the video of his speech, but if you are pressed for time you can read my notes.</p>

<p>This talk is more somber, as we must mention challenges. The theme for this conference is “changing the shape of wisdom” – yes, that is true, very, very true.</p>

<p><strong>Problems and</strong> <strong>promises</strong></p>

<p>Globalization – nation-states are becoming less important, people are moving together and faster. It generating great wealth and leaving people behind. Globalization is not seen as beneficial by some, people who feel they are being crushed by interests outside of their control. Population growth is increasingly putting pressure on natural resources. Access to fundamental rights – food, shelter, safety, education – are being denied. Young people are pressing for education, employment. Societal progression – it has happened, among women especially. But there is more to be done. Wars, terrorism, refugees, rebellions, child soldiers – why do we have them now?</p>

<p>What does it cost of equip a soldier vs. a classroom? Books or bombs? That is the question. Napoleon Bonaparte said, “In the long run the sword is always beaten by the spirit” He proved that quote, as his victory was wiped away, his legacy was his system of governance, of education-based government bureaucracy, civil codes, etc.</p>

<p>We need peace – we cannot continue to wage war. We have universal declaration of human rights. In Article 19, everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression to seek, receive information from a multiplicity of sources.</p>

<p><strong>Freedom of expression</strong></p>

<p>We must re-affirm the polity of humans that share those ideals. Books will stay. Book banning: censorship contravenes human rights. Information cannot be denied – like standing before a tidal wave. Social pressure is a form of censorship – freedom of expression must be protected.</p>

<p><strong>Freedom of access</strong></p>

<p>Print can sometimes be out of reach – not just out of print but too pricey. “We can provide all information to all people at all times” – our motto at the Library. Free flow of information is important. We’ve had a shortage of books – now with the Internet we have too much information. Like going from a drought to fire hose. We need it just right – not just for children of the rich, but children of the poor.</p>

<p>Sometimes copyright issues can put things out of reach. 70% of works are in copyright and out of print. But copyright is in Universal Declaration of human rights too. My credo: all information to all people at all times. Innovators and authors must benefit, but public must have broad access.</p>

<p><strong>What the BA is doing</strong></p>

<p>Massive amount of archiving about Egypt – ancient documents, modern Egypt documents. Digitizing 5k books / month. Creating a Supercourse for free education of all kinds throughout Egypt. Development gateway – websites of NGOs available in their local language. We want to partner with open source efforts.</p>

<p>The future looks great in terms of technology. The future in terms of society is another story.</p>

<p><strong>In defense of values</strong></p>

<p>We talk about the knowledge-based society, but we must remember that knowledge is more than information. Data -&gt; information -&gt; knowledge -&gt; wisdom. Wise decisions made are different than knowledgeable decisions. No scientific answer to the normative. Knowledge requires we rethink values. Values of science: Truth, honor, creativity and imagination, constructive subversiveness – advance by overthrowing the old, tolerance of engagement, and arbitration of disputes based on rationality, evidence, and discussion.</p>

<p>Requires participation – wiki community has shown this. Power of the civil society forces government to be responsible and capable. Putnam – Making Democracy Work. Civil society thrives on information flows.</p>

<p>Parable of story of the flute and children – adjudicate who gets the flute:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I am poor, others are rich – equity</li>
  <li>I can play the flute, others cannot – utility</li>
  <li>I made the flute myself – entitlement</li>
</ol>

<p>No scientific answer to this question.</p>

<p><strong>In defense of youth</strong></p>

<p>Newton, Einstein, Heisenberg, Watson, Turing – they were all young.</p>

<p>To change the shape of wisdom we have to trust our youth, dare to dream, we can do things different. There are forces of Arab society against us, but we can win. Look at Antarctica – a whole continent kept for a bunch of penguins and science, free of econ interests and military bases. Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement, and now Obama is a nominee for President.</p>

<p>It is not impossible to provide all information to all people at all times!</p>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>In short, I built a script that dynamically generates a robots.txt file for search engine bots, who download the file when they seek direction on what parts of a website they are allowed to index. By default, it directs all bots to stay away from the entire site, but then presents an exception: only the bot that requests the robots.txt file is allowed full reign over the site. If Google’s bot downloads the robots.txt file, it will see that only Google’s bot gets to index the entire site. If Yahoo’s bot downloads the robots.txt file, it will see that only Yahoo’s bot gets to index the entire site. Of course, this is assuming that bots identify themselves to my server in a way that they recognize when it is reflected back to them.</p>

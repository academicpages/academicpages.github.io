        <p>This is a paper I wrote for a class on “Technology and Critique” – a class that blended critical theory with Science and Technology Studies.  Taking from Bruno Latour’s “Do you believe in Reality?  News from the Trenches of the Science Wars,” this work is a critical examination of the way in which the on-line encyclopedia Wikipedia has been implicitly cast as a continuation of the Science Wars.  Instead of debating about the efficacy and authority of science, academics are now debating the efficacy and authority of Wikipedia. Using Martin Heidegger’s work on ontology and technology, I argue that this particular academic mindset is a way of being-in-the-world that works to either affirm or negate the integration of Wikipedia into its particular projects – namely, the production of academic knowledge.  However, I show that asking whether Wikipedia is a reliable academic source enframes Wikipedia into an objectless standing-reserve of potential citations, foreclosing many other possibilities for its use.  Instead of following Steven Colbert and countless academics by asking what Wikipedia has done to reality, I ask: what have we done to Wikipedia in the name of reality?</p>

  <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;"> When others ask about my academic works and interests, I usually describe myself as someone who comes from a rather multidisciplinary background – philosophy, anthropology, rhetoric, Science and Technology Studies (STS) – and am interested in collaborative and user-generated content on the Internet.<span> </span>Specifically, I talk about my interest in Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia that anyone can edit.<span> </span>The last item in this list usually raises some eyebrows, as it seems that everyone in academia has some sort of opinion on this radically new form of knowledge production that pops up nearly every time one queries any major web search engine like Google or Yahoo.<span> </span>Assuming that such a conversation was not merely a formal pleasantry, the following line frequently arises in some form or another: “Here is the problem I have with Wikipedia.”<span> </span></span>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal;">
  <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Often spoken slowly, this sentence is uttered as if it is the preface to what will be a devastating argument, one that will innocently erode my entire research and undermine the subject of my study.<span> </span>“Here is the problem,” they say. “No matter how good on average Wikipedia becomes, no matter how many times <em>Nature </em>certifies it as accurate, and no matter how many people are there checking every edit, there is always the chance that someone has slipped in some disinformation immediately before you visit an article.”<span> </span>Despite the fact that I have heard this critique of Wikipedia countless times, I am still unsure how to answer it.<span> </span>For now, I have settled on the strategy of making myself look confused and asking, “So?”</span>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal;">
  <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">This usually evokes an intended response of subsequent confusion by my inquisitor.<span> </span>“So?<span> </span>What do you mean, so?<span> </span>It means that Wikipedia can never be reliable, no matter how much time and effort is put into it,” I am told.<span> </span>I can do nothing but agree, although I have absolutely no idea why any of this should matter.<span> </span>“Obviously, there are going to be errors” I begin, but am interrupted.<span> </span>“But the errors in academic publications are different,” comes a pre-emptive response to an objection I did not intend to make.<span> </span>Who said anything about academic publishing, and why is it being compared to Wikipedia?<span> </span>When I tell them that I do not see Wikipedia as a reliable source, and especially when I state that academic publications are far more trustworthy than the user-edited encyclopedia, the conversation shifts dramatically.<span> </span>I apparently was on their side after all.</span>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal;">
  <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">But whose side am I on, anyway, and more importantly, who are we fighting against?<span> </span>This is revealed with another type of conversation I tend to have with academics – one that happens less often, I should add.<span> </span>After I talk about how I come from philosophy, anthropology, rhetoric, and STS and that am also interested in Wikipedia, their eyes light up.<span> </span>“You know,” the conversation sometimes starts, “I used to not allow my students to cite Wikipedia in their papers.”<span> </span>The confessional continues, sometimes with a rather lengthy narrative about how they started spending time browsing the encyclopedia and found it to be an invaluable resource in their own work.<span> </span>Triumphantly, they often conclude by stating something to the effect of, “And even <em>Science </em>and <em>Nature </em>have to print retractions sometimes, right?” </span>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal;">
  <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">So these are the battle lines: to cite or not to cite.<span> </span>Those who are “pro-Wikipedia” see the encyclopedia as a valuable and reliable academic resource that can be cited like any other reference work.<span> </span>Those who are “anti-Wikipedia” see the encyclopedia as one that is inherently unstable, and most assuredly not something that should be cited in any scholarly work.<span> </span>In short, it draws on the question: Is Wikipedia accurate?</span>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal;">
  <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">In this war, the lines have been drawn and academics are taking sides: <em>Nature</em> famously published an article in which they compared Wikipedia to the Encyclopedia Britannica, and found that they roughly contained the same amount of errors.<span> </span>Subsequent comparisons have been published in academic journals, most notably <em>The Chronicle of Higher Education</em>, which gave high marks to some articles and near-failing ones to others.<span> </span>The article, titled “Can Wikipedia Ever Make the Grade?” ended with a note of ambivalence that implied a negative answer to the question raised.<span> </span>In a well-cited article published in <em>The Journal of American History,</em> Roy Rosenzweig made the same argument, but suggested that academics should work on Wikipedia. The History department of Middlebury College famously voted to ban the use of Wikipedia in papers, and have been called the most reactionary when it comes to the encyclopedia.<span> </span></span>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal;">
  <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Let us examine one of the most widely cited academic articles on Wikipedia: <em>Nature</em>’s 2005 “Internet Encyclopedia’s go Head to Head.”<span> </span>The editorial staff at <em>Nature</em> sent two copies of the same scientific article from Wikipedia and Britannica Online to experts, and asked them to review them for “factual errors, omissions or misleading statements.”<span> </span>With 162 total errors in Wikipedia and 132 in Britannica, the journal concluded that “Jimmy Wales&#8217; Wikipedia comes close to Britannica in terms of the accuracy of its science entries.”<span> </span>In slightly more than one-thousand words, <em>Nature </em>significantly increased Wikipedia’s credibility in the academic eye, without materially changing any of Wikipedia’s content.<span> </span>Simply by being vetted by <em>Nature </em>against <em>Britannica </em>was taken as a sign of accuracy by many.<span> </span>Subsequent studies of a similar nature followed, the most notable being Roy Rosenweig’s “Can History Be Open Source?” published in The Journal of American History and Brock Read’s “Can Wikipedia Ever Make the Grade?” published in The Chronicle of Higher Education.<span> </span>In both, the goal and result was the same: to examine the reliability of Wikipedia’s articles and come to a conclusion regarding their scholarly quality; both gave mixed reviews indicating that Wikipedia was good, but far from perfect.</span>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in; line-height: normal;">
  <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;">Taking a look at scholarly articles regarding Wikipedia, the most cited and/or relevant articles according to various databases are almost always about the project’s reliability, and implicitly or explicitly its worthiness of being an academic source.<span> </span>What follows are EBSCO’s Academic Search Premier’s top ten scholarly articles about Wikipedia, sorted by the database’s relevance scale.<span> </span>Below each title is a quote from the article.</span>

    <p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>In short, I built a script that dynamically generates a robots.txt file for search engine bots, who download the file when they seek direction on what parts of a website they are allowed to index. By default, it directs all bots to stay away from the entire site, but then presents an exception: only the bot that requests the robots.txt file is allowed full reign over the site. If Google’s bot downloads the robots.txt file, it will see that only Google’s bot gets to index the entire site. If Yahoo’s bot downloads the robots.txt file, it will see that only Yahoo’s bot gets to index the entire site. Of course, this is assuming that bots identify themselves to my server in a way that they recognize when it is reflected back to them.</p>

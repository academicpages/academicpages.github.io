title: "Diagnostic expectations in housing price dynamics"
excerpt: Using the Survey of Consumer Expectations, I find the predictability of forecast error on the forecast in housing price growth rate. Overestimation is followed by disappointment in the housing market. To resolve the predictability without rational expectation (RE), I introduce the diagnostic expectation (DE) into a two-agent New Keynesian framework to understand the role of over-optimism from DE in affecting housing price dynamics and business cycles. Firstly, the DE significantly outperforms RE in affecting the responses of housing price, consumption, output, and other variables to TFP shock in magnitude and persistency. The DE plays a significant role in affecting both the extensive and intensive margin of the housing market. Secondly, the DE can generate a positive residential housing value share response that is consistent with data. The key mechanism comes from the strengthened income effect and consumption smoothing under overreaction. Thirdly, the monetary policy rule’s impacts on the DE mechanisms suggest important policy implications.

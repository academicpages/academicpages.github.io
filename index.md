I’m a **Registered Nurse** and **Electronics Engineering student** at the University of South-Eastern Norway, specializing in **microtechnology and computer systems**.  
My background combines hands-on clinical experience from some of Norway’s largest hospitals with a growing technical expertise in programming, embedded systems, and medical technology.

I’m passionate about how **innovation and technology can strengthen healthcare**, address workforce shortages, and improve patient safety and quality of care.  
Beyond my studies and clinical work, I’m also committed to **mentoring young girls and women**, encouraging them to explore careers in **science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)**. I believe diversity and inclusion are essential to drive the next wave of technological innovation in healthcare and beyond.

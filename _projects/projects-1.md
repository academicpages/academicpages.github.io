Inspection is an important phase that will play a critical part in On-orbit servicing missions. I worked on solving this problem by considering complex objectives - minimize fuel usage, power usage and maximize coverage. To enable optimization of this complex objective, I used a sample based motion planning algorithm. Unique characteristics of the problems are coupled translation and attitude motion, collision and pointing constraints. The results of this work showed that the framework can be applied for single and multi satellite configurations. Please have a look at my thesis to get more information.

An international team consisting of Cecilia Clementi(Rice University), Mauro 
Maggioni (Duke University) Shantenu Jha (Rutgers University), Glenn Martyna 
(BM T. J. Watson Laboratory ), Charlie Laughton (University of Nottingham), Ben 
Leimkuhler ( University of Edinburgh), Iain Bethune (University of Edinburgh) 
and Panos Parpas(Imperial College) are supported through the SI2-CHE program 
for the development of ExTASY -- Extensible Toolkit for Advanced Sampling and 
analYsis, -- a conceptual and software framework that provides a step-change in 
the sampling of the conformational space of macromolecular systems. 
Specifically, ExTASY is a lightweight toolkit to enable first-class support for 
ensemble-based simulations and their seamless integration with dynamic analysis 
capabilities and ultra-large time step integration methods, whilst being 
extensible to other community software components via well-designed and standard
interfaces.

The primary impacts of this project are in the biological sciences. This 
software advances our understanding of biologically important systems, as it 
can be used to obtain fast and accurate sampling of the conformational dynamics 
of stable proteins ? a prerequisite for the accurate prediction of thermodynamic
parameters and biological functions. It also allows tackling systems like 
intrinsically disordered proteins, which can be beyond the reach of classical 
structural biology. Along with the research itself, the PIs are involved with 
outreach programs to attract high school students to science.

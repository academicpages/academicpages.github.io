The study of hazards and renewable energy are paramount for the development and 
sustainability of society. Similarly, the emergence of new climatic patterns 
pose new challenges for future societal planning. Geospatial data are being 
generated at unprecedented rate exceeding our analysis capabilities and leading 
towards a data-rich but knowledge-poor environment. The use of advanced 
computing tools and techniques are playing an increasingly important role in 
contributing to solutions to problems of societal importance. This project will 
create specialized computational tools that will enhance the ability of 
scientists to effectively and efficiently study natural hazards and renewable 
energy. The use of these tools will support novel methods and the use of 
powerful computing resources in ways that are not currently possible.

Many scientific applications in the field of Earth Sciences are increasingly 
reliant on “ensemble-based” methods to make scientific progress. This is true 
for applications that are both net producers of data, as well as aggregate 
consumers of data. In response to the growing importance and pervasiveness of 
ensemble-based applications and analysis, and to address the challenges of 
scale, simplicity and flexibility, we propose the Ensemble Toolkit for Earth 
Sciences. The Ensemble Toolkit will provide an important addition to the set 
of capabilities and tools that will enable the Earth Science community to use 
high-performance computing resources more efficiently, effectively and in an 
extensible fashion. This project represents the co-design of Ensemble Toolkit 
for Earth Sciences and is a collective effort of an interdisciplinary team of 
cyber-infrastructure and domain scientists. It will also support the integration 
of the Ensemble Toolkit with a range of science applications, as well as its 
use in solving scientific problems of significant societal impact that are 
currently unable to utilize the collective capacity of supercomputers, campus 
clusters and clouds.

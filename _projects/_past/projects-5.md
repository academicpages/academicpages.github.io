I was part of the University space club called “Polispace” as a Junior project manager. In this position, I handled a team of 10 undergraduates working towards the AIAA space mission design competition. I was responsible for providing them with necessary knowledge and skills to deal with space mission design. Here is video of me presenting the team to the youtube live aundience on the launch day of Polispace.

Particularly, I was teaching and directing them with AOCS, Orbital mechanics and System engineering aspects. The team successfully finished the project and published a conference paper on [International Astronautical Congress 2021 Dubai](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355856339_Phase-A_Design_of_ICE_CREAM_a_cost-effective_Mars_Sample_Return_Mission).
